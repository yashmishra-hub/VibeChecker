I will describe my experience in short.
Cello Butterflow
Nothing special about this pen. Just purchased because it was a classic. It has the thinnest refill among them.
Classmate Octane
A classic! I like the rubber grip and it's thicker than other pens so it's comfortable for me. It has the largest refill among them. While the ink was darker when I purchased it but it got lighter as time went by.
Doms Inxo Classic
I have DOMS Inxon too but I like this. My Inxon pen ink has gone light as time passed by. But this is still the same as the day it was purchased. I like the looks of this but it seems to be inspired from Pentonic + Unomax had a baby.
Flair Glass
This is inspired from Muji pens. I have Glass Gel but the grip in Glass gel is not comfortable for me because of the ridge in grip section but Glass ball has fixed this. The grip is slimmer than other pens, I like Yolo from Flair as the grip is thicker and more comfortable. Another thing is that Flair & Hauser ball pen inks don't seem to get light as time passes, I have finished entire refills and they have stayed dark as they were on day 1. Hauser is owned by Flair.
Pentonic Ball
Most of the pens use a needle tip but this one uses a hybrid tip (conical+needle). Sometimes I feel this is better than Hauser XO and vice versa. The design is a little serious but it comes in Frost and Colors series which has different body colours and makes it more attractive for students. I don't like that Pentonic uses a slim refill compared to others. The same is applicable for B-RT, it also has a very thin refill. Yes, Pentonic ink also goes light with time so that is another con.
Unomax Ultron
This is the best ball pen according to me. The grip is perfect. It uses a large refill. The ink is not very dark so no smudges and bleeding/showthrough, the ink also flows perfectly so I am in control of the pen. You know sometimes when the pen is very smooth and it makes it slippery so you cannot control your handwriting. But this pen has one issue and it's the same as others. The ink goes light after some but you must try this pen if you have not tried it yet, one more thing is this body is compatible with Flair and Hauser Ball pen refills so if you like Hauser XO and don't like it's grip you can use Hauser XO refills in this pen.
Unomax Boldtron
When I first started writing with this I didn't like it as it was thicker than other ball pens but it is the smoothest ₹10 ball pen that I have tried. And it's very comfortable for long writing especially exams. One more benefit is that since the tip is bold (thick) you fill your answer sheet quickly. See it will take some time to adjust to this pen. I didn't like writing with it for the first two weeks. But I wrote 1 A4 page daily for 3 weeks, after 2 weeks my hands and handwriting both got adjusted. So once you start writing with this pen, you won't go back to 0.7mm pens again. One con is that refills are not available for boldtron and the body colour is ugly, you can use the boldtron refill in Ultron if you want to have a nice looking pen.
So what's your favourite ₹10 ball pen?
Any suggestions that I should try?","['https://preview.redd.it/oitznyx22r2f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0a2596581e373574007a9b10e0d82ab623fc91b2', 'https://preview.redd.it/mrzg2xx22r2f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=eae55a042f1dbe4e0df3c5a655ecb4579db5b19e', 'https://preview.redd.it/70b2rux22r2f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=598db4d26e3e3f29d28f2fda9ddf67115a36d3d8', 'https://preview.redd.it/orm1osx22r2f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a7bd4c0ee7bab218411922d6b056f90ec0cad0e7', 'https://preview.redd.it/2phq0tx22r2f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=993df796f9663c54345717f995704d101828d6cb', 'https://preview.redd.it/j67yqsx22r2f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=05a5a78f4c94c25dddc0b62904ee016f1427914a', 'https://preview.redd.it/jx1dhb162r2f1.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f5a2cc1af8c604e59576ffa889d20cb3f28f5058']"

She literally went under the table and then got stuck there, wasting 10 minutes at least. Then another girl was doing some palm reading shi and I don't believe in allat but she grabbed my hand, touched me very uncomfortablely then looked at me and said ""Tereko na jb tu 19-20 ki hogi to ek bohot serious disease hogi...

JEENEETards,https://old.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/1ku4pzp/the_students_who_wasted_time_are_they_actually/,5036,1087,The students who “wasted time” — are they actually winning?,"I used to think, “Let them party, chill, waste their time — they’ll be unemployed later anyway.”
And for the longest time, that thought made me feel... secure? Like I was on the “right” path. Like I was doing something meaningful while others were just messing around.
But now I’m not so sure. Was any of that even true?
In Indian families (especially the middle-class kind), it’s drilled into us that
if you're not studying, you're screwing up your life
. Partying? Distraction. Dating? Distraction. Hanging out too much? Distraction. Low marks? You’ve basically failed as a person.
And we believe it. I did too. I bought into it so much that I’d resent those who weren’t as focused as me but still got praised by teachers or liked by everyone.
You start thinking that being buried in books automatically makes you better — more focused, more disciplined, more likely to “succeed.” And anything outside that — fun, experiences, people — all that becomes something you silently judge others for. But also something you avoid because it feels unfamiliar and uncomfortable.
Now I look around, and the same people who were “distracted” in school? They’re fine. Some of them are doing
really
well. They’re confident, socially smart, more balanced. Meanwhile, I feel like I skipped learning how to actually live.
No hate to studying. It’s obviously important. But I think the idea that marks and focus are
everything
, and that anyone who lived differently was somehow wrong or beneath us — that idea was flawed from the start.
Anyway, this has been sitting in my head for a while, so just putting it out there. Anyone else feel like they were trained to be “good students” but maybe not actual functioning people?

It's fucking scary,"So ladies and mentalgents, I'm back with another lore. So i was finally admitted to a hospital for my cancer, there are people my age. Made some friends. There was this one guy my age. 25tard hi tha, tho he wasn't prepping for any entrance or anything. He had AML
My 16th - his condition went too bad. He was shaking. His mother was crying like anything. Nurses were all around him. I saw his hands fall to the bed(he's on the bed just left to me) I thought he's gone. It was fucking scary to watch. His mom banging thr chair, crying in tears. I have the recording coz I was talking with someone and it got recorded.. it haunts me.
He was taken to icu. I got the news today that he passed away this Sunday. Man fuck cancer.
RIP Prajal. You will be missed.
We made plans, he said he'll be able to walk in a few days. I overheard him talking to the nurses about his birthday. It was on 9th june. I noted it. Thought I'd wish him on the day. We laughed about how we will share about how we met our gurlies, the lores. I was so fucking happy that he seemed to be improving. His last chemo worked good. But... Suddenly... Everything shattered. The guy I knew for just 26 days, the friend with whom I planned to meet once he's alright (he's from near our place, that hits harder), it all shattered. We had a good bonding over the few days.
Hospitals are scary. I wish nobody has to go through cancer anytime in their life. It's awful.
I'm not even crying. I didn't even shed a single tear. I wonder why. Seeing kids my age at way worse condition than me humbled me for good. Nothing seems more important than life now, uk, the sooner you realise it, the better.
I'd just tell everyone, hit the gym, be healthy and be thankful for everything you've got. What you have now is what someone is yearning for. Be thankful for every single day. I myself wasn't. I complained still. Life is more than just exams, job, and finances. Make your life beautiful, not luxurious. I myself have a final Survival rate of 30%, I'm yearning to live, which you're doing. So donot with full enthusiasm. Once you face something like cancer, you wouldn't dare making exams your entire personality. I'm facing the same",https://i.redd.it/9edfoo39gx1f1.png

My mock scores were above 160 if I tried and if I didn't they would fall as low  till 30's. My coaching started taking full mocks from december I scored smthg in 20-30 in my first mock but later it stretched till 90's till mid december. I was happy considering if I pushed myself more I could get till 150 (hopium i know). but from 26 dec I started suffering from major health issues and was later admitted in hospital till 19 Jan. Yet my parents and relatives forced me to give the exam. I knew I was doomed. Had panic attack night before 22nd and before going to the exam center. Heck even while writing the exam my head started throbbing so much it made my mind blank. I could even remember the simplest formulae. Fuck I even might score in negative. I cried for the whole day. Anyways. It was yesterday midnight when I woke to due to a sudden noise and found my mother lying unconscious in bathroom. She had taken bunch of painkillers. I called my dad and we rushed to hospital. 6 hrs later my mom gains consciousness. After doing checkup and stuff the doctors and my dad leave the room, I hugged my mom and started crying asking her why she did this. She had blank facial expressions, she looked straight in my eyes and said ""agar ek aur exam kharab gaya tho tere samne latak jaungi"".
this happened like 30 mins ago. I have no idea what to do? am sitting in the hospital's bathroom bawling my eyes out. fuck I can't believe a person wants to off themself because of me. My hands are shaking. Do I even deserve to live? I don't wanna share this with my irl friends; they have their exam on 28th and making them worry is the last thing I wanna do. My whole family hates me. I feel hopeless.
Sorry for the rant.",

There’s tbh no hope left in this justice system which makes us feel worthless
So it all starts with a group project we are doing rn. 
For context- I am a first year student at IITB.
There’s a guy in our team, and he’s from cse. Generally anyone expects them to be good with acads, math skills, and even quite good at retaining jee concepts. 
I have worked with him for quite a long now and slowly and slowly I discovered that something’s fishy in here. 
The guy was not at all aware of basic physics , some basic math manipulation’s and coding(which majority of us now by now). 
Initially I believed ki let’s not burden him with work, might be from a reserved category and would collaborate with us as time passes, while learning new things.
One day I asked him frankly about his jee performance and all. He was throwing all possible reasons to avoid these talks. Somehow later I got to know his rank through one of my friends.
I was hell out of mind that day.
He had an AIR of 151!!
Like bro that’s not possible! I had a decent rank, I know the iq of ppl in general around my rank, ppl above me and in general at iitb here. He was lower than anyone present here. 
Later I researched a bit more, scrolled yt( obviously u could search any guy on yt from iitb cse and u would find him on multiple channels) and found he studied from PW.
I had fucking blew my mind when I read he had 78%ile in mains. 
Any sane guy, who has the potential to score <200 in advanced can crack the mains general cutoff without lifting a pen!!
And here ppl believe that 78%ile to air 151 is all about hard work and perseverance. 
Damn that shit!
Obviously that is CHEATING!
I researched a bit more lol and I found his roll no next to the guy who had scored AIR 21!
(For context if someone doesn’t know, u get your computers in exam centre roll no wise).
Now the droppers or anyone who has cleared jee knows that it isn’t hard to crack the exam if a topper sits besides you.
This guy has had such an insane amount of luck.
For proofs I have attached the pics, y’all can access them from jee 2023 reports.
The justice system in the country is shit! 
First u blame the reservation and then these morons for stealing your seats. 
I mean come on  such a prestigious exam of the country and these ppl don’t even check who’s peeping into someone’s screen. 
Even if let’s say that if even invigilatorss couldn’t catch them on that day, they could have devised an algorithm before publishing the results that the ppl having adjacent roll no, if they end up scoring equally good ranks, it would get fishy and just check the cctv footage’s once. 
But he’ll no!!
Justice is just a joke in this country .
Ppl here spend bloody 3 4 years preparing for an exam and no justice in the system.
This is just one case mind it. 
I can catch plenty of them but doing that just makes me hate the system and country to the core.
TLDR- suspicious of a guy in my team, turned up he cheated in jee advanced  and got into iitbombay cse.","['https://preview.redd.it/74l2z3x1vmsc1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c42bb54926137d7dbf215bcee5b5f66fee179756', 'https://preview.redd.it/w7er5mx1vmsc1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3405f6b660d926fb5672511f6c21a3f7169a7b1b', 'https://preview.redd.it/fcz9okx1vmsc1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=19150dbf7ceb5154134c755d390d49d3efb6564e']"

So I asked tu thik hai na. He said he had just cut his wrist and he is bleeding, I told him to go to his parents rooms but he didn't went there.
I called him uncountable times till morning, a hour ago his father picked the phone and said they took him to nearby hospital, he was declared dead there and they would head to the ghat later for last rights.
I am crying right now, he was a genius, knew 4 languages, excellent in coding, his only problem was he was bad in PCM.
My buddy failed in 12th boards and mains 1 and mains 2. He submitted chem paper blank. He became a porn addict and got ED, became depressed and suicidal, I thought I saved him but I was wrong.
I just wanted to tell him he was a great friend and an excellent guy.
Hope he is at peace now, I am also on verge of suicide I have lost a friend, Jee and allmost every other thing I used to have.
His final words were "" pls make me proud I just can't take it, talking with you was the best thing happened to me, pls take care"".
I hope I can meet him again someday.",
