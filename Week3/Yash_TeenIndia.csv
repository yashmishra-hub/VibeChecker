TeenIndia,https://old.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1iszaar/help/,20757,1360,Help,"I (18M) started talking to this girl (19F) on reddit. She told me about her life , about her ex and all , she asked me do I have a girlfriend , how tall am i etc , after that she elaborated about her breakup and stuff. She told me she was gonna delete her account. Idk why but my dumbass thought of telling her what i thought , I told her that I like her , obviously who would accept it , this was on 13 February. She deleted her account that day. 
My reddit account got banned on 15th February under some circumstances and on 12:05 AM of that night , I got a message invite , as you all might now , when you are banned on reddit , you can't post , comment , or reply to anybody's messages. When I opened that message invite , it was her , she kept on messaging me throughout the day like her first message was on 12:05 AM then 12:20 AM then 12:23 PM and on an on. My account was banned for three days so I couldn't reply , during the night of 16th February at 11:53 PM she sent her last message , she was very emotional at that time and I was dying to talk to her , but my luck fucked me up real bad , after 10 minutes she deleted her account , initially I had thought that I would message her as soon as the ban lifts up but my dumbass couldn't think that I can make a new account and message her straight away. Jeevan mei pehli baar koi ladki mili thi jissey mujhse farak padta tha , lekin , i fucked up. The purpose of this post is she left a comment on one of the posts in this sub from her 2nd account , so I think she's active here. Just in case she made a 3rd account and joined this sub , she would see this post. 
Her username was Dry-Cattle-1383 (2nd account). I don't even know her name , i don't even know how she looks , I don't know where she lives but wherever you are , I am waiting for you. 
Guys plz upvote this post so it might reach her
[Edit : Found her , thanks to all those who helped me 🫡🤝🫂]",

At first, I thought I wouldn’t get involved in this situation at all. But then I read through the comments, and something in me shifted a bit — kind of a change of heart. I decided that I should help that girl.
So, the same guy who had sent me the video , I called him up and convinced him to help her too, since he was the only one who actually knew the guy’s address. After that, I gathered 3-4 other decent guys, and they agreed to help as well.
Then we started planning — where to catch the guy, what exactly to do, all that stuff. The guy who sent me the video told us that the dude usually gets home from school around 1:30, since he used to be his neighbor and knew his routine.
Now it was time to execute.
As soon as the guy got off the bus and entered the building lift, we — around 3-4 of us , surrounded him. We started questioning him, and when we told him that we’d go tell his mom everything, he freaked out. Started apologizing, said he wouldn’t do it again, that he’d delete the video, and even said, “bhaiya mujhe maarlo lekin mummy ko kuch mt btana(You guys can beat me up, just don’t tell my parents.)” Then he just collapsed on the spot.
So we dragged him to his mom and told her everything he had done. At first, she wasn’t ready to believe us — but then we showed her the video. After that, we roughed him up a bit and he admitted to everything. His mom started crying and called his dad.
She was actually a really good person — promised us that he wouldn’t ever do anything like this again. Then aunty called the girl over, apologized to her, and spoke to her privately for like 10–15 minutes.
After that, the girl thanked all of us and ended up hugging the guy who had actually bought her video for 500 bucks 🤡 — thinking he was the one who helped her 🤗. I didn’t even try to take credit, but when we walked out, that guy genuinely seemed to have a change of heart. And honestly, that’s what made me happy the most.

I genuinely can’t wrap my head around it, and I don’t understand why people don’t see it.
It’s like the standards have completely collapsed and nobody cares anymore.
This is horribly wrong, yet somehow it’s treated like it’s just another normal thing.
Why do they even do it? Is it for attention? Is it a trend?
Do they find this cool?
Do they actually enjoy it, or are they just pretending so they can fit in?
It’s like common sense, taste, and self-respect got thrown out of the window at the same time.

This morning, I came home after running when my sister asked me to drop her near the private bus stand where her frien(her PG roommate) was waiting. I dropped her off and was about to leave on my scooty when suddenly she screamed my name. I turned and saw a guy running straight toward me. I thought he was a thief or something, so I grabbed his collar, but since he was running and I was about to start the scooty, we both fell.
I quickly got up and asked, ""Kya churaya hai?"" My sister and her friend ran over, and my sister, looking shocked, said, ""Chest par chhukar bhaga."" NGL, if the crowd hadn't gathered, I would've killed him. I punched him straight in the face while he was on the ground, and I don't even know what else I did—probably kicked him too. The crowd gathered, and some uncles and aunties ne bhi apna ghussa nikal diya
I told my sister to skip today and go tomorrow, but she refused, saying she had a test at coaching. I was still worried, but later she called me after reaching and thanked me, saying she got there safely.
[Edit-  Thanks for all the respect and appreciation and i really really regret i didnt reported it to poilce , I was too tired at that time as i did a 2-3km run at early morning and then all this , i accept it was very immature of me that i didnt report it and i will make sure to do it next time if anything similar happen]",

1) Private Part Hygiene 😶‍🌫️💦
Nahate toh sab hi honge, but how many of you were taught how to clean down there properly?
Koi nahi, aaj tumhara bhai batayega 😎
Sabse pehle, daily wash karo. Pani sirf dalna kaafi nahi hota, you need to actually clean it properly.
If you're uncircumcised – Pull back the foreskin and wash under it. Haan bhai, wash under it. Wahan white-white ganda layer (smegma) jama ho jata hai jo smell aur infections cause kar sakta hai. Lukewarm water se achhe se clean karo but soap wahan mat lagana, kyunki sensitive area hota hai.
If you're circumcised – Wash the whole area with lukewarm water and mild soap. Har roz. Koi excuse nahi chalega.
Pubic hair trim karna chaaho toh kar sakte ho, but agar rakho toh clean rakhna compulsory hai. Sweat, bacteria aur odor sab jama hota hai wahan, toh dhang se wash karo.
Baath ke baad achhe se dry karo. Pura dry nahi kiya toh fungal infection ka free pass mil jayega.
2) Underwear Matters 🩲
Roz ka underwear change nahi karoge toh congratulations, tumhare paas bacteria ka naya colony khul gaya hai 🥳.
💠 Cotton underwear lo, synthetic me ventilation kam hoti hai aur sweat absorb nahi hota.
💠 Night me loose boxers ya free balling (without underwear) best hai. Air circulation zaroori hai.
💠 Tight underwear 24/7 mat pehno, sperm count aur circulation dono effect hota hai.
3) Smell = Turn-Off 🚫
💠 Armpits, groin, feet – ye sab sweat factory hote hain. Sweat = bacteria = smell.
💠 Deodorant use karo (but not on private part, bhai mar jaoge)
💠 Feet smell ko ignore mat karo, socks roz change karo aur agar shoes se smell aa rahi hai toh usko dho lo ya baking soda daal ke fresh karo.
4) Manscaping / Grooming ✂️
💠 Pubic hair trim karna tumhari choice hai, but agar rakho toh dhang se clean rakho.
💠 Too much trimming = chubhti hui regrowth (use trimmer with guard instead of shaving completely)
💠 Nails cut karo, bacteria wahan bhi collect hota hai.
5) Wash Your Hands After Using the Washroom 🚿
Bro, bas paani fekna aur nikalna is not washing 💀. Sab kuch touch karte ho washroom me, toh properly hands dho na zaroori hai.
6) Discharge and Health Issues 🩻
💠 White / yellowish discharge from penis = check up karwao.
💠 Itching / redness / rashes = fungal infection ho sakta hai.
💠 Pain while peeing = UTI ho sakti hai, doctor ke paas jao.
Agar kuch unusual lag raha hai, doctor se consult karna better hai instead of Google pe research karna aur khud ka dar banana.
Yehi sabse important tips the, baaki comment karke aur add karna agar kuch reh gaya ho.
Hygiene is not just for girls, ladke bhi clean rehna sikho!

TeenIndia,https://old.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1l2xv9o/cricket_is_overrated_downvotes_are_welcome/,9153,595,Cricket is overrated . Downvotes are welcome. 🙂,"Cricket has given India unforgettable moments — from World Cup wins to legends like Dhoni, Kohli, and Sachin. It's deeply rooted in our culture, and there's no denying the joy it brings to millions. But in a country of 1.4 billion people, shouldn't there be room for
more
?
India is home to incredibly talented athletes in sports like hockey, wrestling, boxing, athletics, kabaddi, shooting, and even chess. These athletes bring home medals, break records, and often do it with far less support, funding, or recognition. Still, they fight on, driven purely by passion and pride.
The problem isn't cricket—it's the imbalance. The media, brands, and audience attention are so focused on one sport that others barely get noticed. Our national sport, hockey, rarely trends. A gold medal in wrestling or a world record in athletics gets a few claps, while a six in IPL creates nationwide headlines.
We’re not asking to replace cricket. We’re just asking to
share the spotlight
. Let's cheer louder for our Olympic heroes, support our local kabaddi leagues, and celebrate achievements in every sport that carries the Indian flag to global heights.
Because India isn’t just a cricket-loving nation. It’s a
sports-loving
nation — it’s just that some of those sports are still waiting to be seen .So please , try to make these players as famous as Kohli and others.

When my mom came the house was a mess food lying here and there, beer bottle, etc. My lonely ass was already frustrated from jee prep.
Then my mom asked him what's wrong with him. He straight up woke up and slapped her. I SWEAR TO GOD I DIDN'T DO IT INTENTIONALLY, THE SLAP CAME OUT LIKE A REFLEX. AND EVERYONE WENT SILENT.

Once a group of aunties supposedly her 'friends' came to my house when my mom wasn't home, obviously I never liked them and maintained a safe distance as to not say anything weird to their faces.
I let them in and they got seated, I managed to strike up small talk and then one of them said 'Beta khaneke liye kuch nhi doge kya?' I felt bad for not realising I hadn't even offered them water. I ran inside the kitchen and got them a few parle g biscuits and a glass of water, they devoured the biscuits while making petty comments about my appearance
It took all of my energy to stay quiet, after they all ate and snorted like pigs, one of them made a comment 'yeh sab toh theek hai lekin hum na Parle G bus kutto ko dete hai, hamare ghar pe toh bus imported european cookies aate hai', that was it, I lost my cool and said 'Ha aunty hum bhi kutto ko hi dete hai' and pushed the plate towards her while she put another biscuit in her mouth. All her minions stared at me while another said 'Kitni besharam ladki hai, na shakal hai na akal' I turned to her and said 'Besharam toh apka beta hai joh apke peeche har din ek naayi ladki ke saath date pe jaata hai aur extra class ke naam pe clubbing jaata hai' and I pulled out my phone and showed her pictures of her son partying which a didi had sent me to warn me to stay away, I didn't take her name obviously (he is 22 years old and has always given me pedo vibes) The other two were quiet because I already had an encounter with one of them before but it was completely unintentional back then and the other was just quiet.
One of them has a son who went to symbiosis institute of technology and she knew I was preparing for JEE. She kept raving about it and I told her that my ambitions were way bigger and I don't wake up everyday dreaming to go to a college 20 minutes away from my house (I apologised later because I realised what I said was wrong)
Anyways they left my house muttering thing like 'besharam, jiske bhi ghar jayegi woh tabha ho jayega, kaandi aurat'
My mom was UPSET when she came back and found out everything but my dad was proud of me.
I now have a reputation of being the besharam ladki and our society is small so the word spread like wildfire.",

Never open up emotionally about your partner or never cry in front of them related to your relationship, i repeat never ever cry in front of your parents regarding your partner or for anything related to your partner.
Yesterday my gf (f21) my travelling with her family to her hometown in car . They met with an dangerous accident as a truck hit them in head on collision. My gf tried to call me but I didn't saw the call. She got very panick after the accident. First thing she did was call me. As I didn't picked up she called on my mother's number. 
And as soon as I (m21) talked to her and got to know about the accident I was in complete shock and started crying immediately. My mother didn't react at that exact moment obviously due to the seriousness of the situation, but after things got little better everyone were safe. Today her behaviour completely changed which I can obviously notice (she didn't liked what happened). And today I got a call from my father and he was lecturing me that I shouldn't be so much sentimental and I should focus on my career blah blah.... .
And I was literally likeee out of words . Parents just can't see their kids worrying and crying for anyone else expect them.

I’ve started a Change,org petition urging the Government of India to make body cameras mandatory for all police officers across the country.
Every day, thousands of citizens interact with the police — during traffic checks, protests, and emergencies. Unfortunately, many of these encounters happen without any record, which means no protection for citizens when rights are violated, and no protection for honest officers when false allegations arise.
Body-worn cameras (BWCs) have proven around the world to increase transparency, reduce misconduct, and build trust between police and the public. India urgently needs this reform.
Our goals:
- Mandatory body cameras for all on-duty police officers.
Secure, tamper-proof storage of footage.
- Clear national guidelines to protect both citizen privacy and officer safety.
- This isn’t anti-police — it’s pro-accountability and pro-justice.
Let’s demand a system where truth has evidence, not just testimony.

I had a conversation with him last month, we talked about how life can take unexpected turns and go in different directions, things we can never predict. I was scrolling through my old Reddit chats today and saw that he had deleted his account. It broke my heart. I felt numb the entire day, constantly wondering where he is now.
I recently went through a breakup, and it made me realize that there are far bigger problems in the world. Life is so unpredictable. I wonder what goes on in people’s minds when they lose their loved ones, when they get diagnosed with major illnesses, or when they struggle with financial instability. Everyone goes through tough times in life.

So I slept at 5AM last night, and my sleep kept on getting disturbed till 6:30 AM, because my mom was getting ready to go for the first jog of her life - with brand new sports shoes purchased from decathlon, a pedometer and a whole lot of excitement.
After a series of sleep disturbances, which ended with my mom and dad (who was going to the gym at the same time)waking me up to lock the door and told me to open it when they come back around 2 hours later, and I slept like a frigging bear in hibernation.
My mom, came back at 8:10AM - rang the doorbell a 100 times, no answer. My dad came back 10 mins later, did the same, no answer from me at all. My dad was trying to break the door, the neighbours rushed out, people from different floors came to my doorstep crowding and ringing the doorbell, banging the door, calling my number (my phone was on silent) and no answer AT ALL.
My parents and literally everyone thought I legit committed suicide or fell down from the bed and broke my head. My father decided to register a SUICIDE case, and call the cops to break the doors.
I WAS SLEEPING LIKE A GODDAMN KOALA, AND DID NOT HEAR ANY COMMOTION HAPPENING OUTSIDE, OR THE BELL BEING RUNG A SOLID  300 TIMES.
( I can't even wake up at alarms, don't hear em ring, but everybody else in the house wakes up, thats the way I sleep (so deeply))
I heard the bell once or twice, but in my deep sleep, I thought I was just dreaming - I totally forgot that my parents must've come back from walking.
At around 10:10 AM, the bell kept on ringing again, I heard it this time, and it all struck me - MY MOM, HER FIRST JOG, AND THAT THEY WERE OUTSIDE.
I finally got up, rushed out and opened the door EXACTLY 2 hours later, to find my parents sitting on the stairs and CRYING their eyes out, and the neighbours, the watchman all around me. I opened the door, ran back inside, and my parents were scream-crying. The neighbours were laughing with a sigh of relief, whereas my parents scolded me like anything before hugging me and telling me how much they loved me, etc, how they thought I must've done something to myself cause of academic pressure or relatives taunts or something.
I saw my father break down for the first time.
What was this morning shocker, I don't know.
Am I just a koala bear disguised as a human, I don't know.
But I know one thing for sure, my parents love me a lot, way more than I can ever imagine.
PS : WILL FIX MY SLEEP SCHEDULE. 🐨
Also My parents are getting calls from all the neighbours to know if their kid opened the door or nah😭",

My little brother and I made the most of it. We packed in as much fun as we could: late-night horror games, Valorant duos, UNO, board games, having noodles out like in the good old days. It was like a rewind on our childhood.
That evening when I was leaving, all was a mess—packing, last-minute panicking, and attempting to absorb the remaining bits of home. We passed by a restaurant for the last time and then proceeded to the station.
In the haste, I bid everyone farewell and jumped out of the car. I assumed that was it.
Then, just as I was wheeling my bag away, he yelled out my name from the car. I stopped—and there he was, extending his hand out of the car window.
Our handshake.
It's this stupid, complicated routine we've had for almost a decade. Something only we know. I sprinted back, horns behind me, and we did it—right there, arm out the window, palms slapping together, fingers interlocking, completing the last move like it was muscle memory. Cars were blasting but in that moment, all else was irrelevant. Just us. One more time.
Then I walked away.
Then cut to the present—2 or 3 weeks later. I was in my bedroom, sorting through my belongings. I had picked up one of my textbooks, the one I quite literally study out of on a daily basis. As I flipped it shut by holding it from behind, a piece of folded paper fell out—from the last pages
I didn't even know it was there. I must have skipped the back page each time.
I opened it slowly. It was his handwriting.
A simple note. Just him saying how much he’s going to miss me. Nothing over the top. Just honest, raw words.
And it broke me a little.
I sat there with the note in my hand, thinking about that rushed goodbye, the handshake, the games, the laughter—and how he never told me about this note. He just hoped I’d find it.
I’m keeping it forever.
I have included the note so that all of you could view it.
TL;DR:
Returned to college after a brief time with my little brother. Played games, dined out, and brought back our childhood. On the way to the station, he called me back just so we could do our signature handshake one last time, in the middle of traffic. Weeks after, I came upon a handwritten note from him concealed on the last page of my book. Never informed me about it—he had it waiting to be discovered. I'm never letting it go.",https://i.redd.it/fe6kef4nmv3f1.jpeg

Almost 5 years ago, I started a YouTube channel. Kept it completely secret from my family. The only person who doubts is my best friend, but I won't tell her the channel name. She used to constantly ask and even stopped talking to me for 2 months over it, but now she's okay and doesn't ask anymore.
My channel got monetized within 6 months. Two weeks ago, I received my gold play button - 
1 million subscribers.
Here's the thing: when I got my silver play button (100k), I was terrified my family would find it at home. So I scratched off the channel name and gave it to my best friend as a ""gift."" She was so happy, thinking I bought her something cool, not knowing it was actually MY achievement.
Today I'm doing the same with the gold button. Can't risk keeping it home, so I'm scratching off my name again and giving away this massive milestone. She'll think it's just another generous gift.
It's so bittersweet - she's literally holding my achievements while having no idea they're actually mine. I'm celebrating by proxy while hiding this huge part of my life.
Has anyone kept something this major secret for so long? How do you deal with not being able to celebrate your wins with people you love?",https://i.redd.it/25hd01u0dxnf1.jpeg

I first saw her on 10 March 2022, during our English final exam in 9th class. From that very day, I had a crush on her, and yeah, it was mutual. What started as a small thing slowly turned into something real.
Throughout 10th, we were best friends. You could probably call it a situationship. We talked every day, spent time together, and without officially saying it, we both knew there was something there. At the start of 11th, we finally got into a relationship.
Honestly, both 10th and 11th were really good for us. Same school, same coaching, same friend group. We used to sit together every day and spent almost 8–10 hours together daily. It felt effortless. Safe. Like this is it.
Then in May, she had to move away and change schools. That is where everything started going downhill.
What was once simple suddenly became long distance. We started having a lot of fights, misunderstandings, and frustration from both sides. It was never about lack of love, it was about lack of time.
It was so normal for us to spend 8–10 hours together every single day, and suddenly we could not even meet properly. That shift was just too much.
By October last year, things had gotten really bad, and she broke up with me. I begged her to at least take a break instead of breaking up, but she was sure about her decision. Still, we kept talking daily. Honestly, nothing major changed even after the breakup.
Around December, she confessed that she felt bad and said she should have just taken a break instead of breaking up with me. She told me she wanted to be in a relationship again. But at that time, my pre-boards were around the corner, and in a few months (March) I had my 12th boards. I told her to wait because I would not be able to give her enough time.
Ironically, I still fucked up my boards.
Then my JEE.
Then my NDA.
In April, I confessed to her again and asked her out. She agreed, and we got back into a relationship. But things again started going downhill.
The main problem, and this was my fault, was how I handled fights. Whenever we argued, my first instinct was to solve everything immediately. In my head, that is how problems are fixed. I completely ignored emotions. My intention was never bad, I just wanted us to be perfect and to work things out.
But in that process, I unknowingly made her feel like something was wrong with her and that she needed to change. That was never my intention, but intention does not change impact. I accept my mistake.
On 13 May, she broke up with me again.
For the first few days, there was silence from both sides. Slowly, we returned to an almost-relationship situation. Call it a situationship, I guess. We were not officially together, but we treated each other like boyfriend and girlfriend.
Before 1 August, she even hinted that I should post her on my story for Girlfriend’s Day. Somewhere in my head, I believed we would eventually get better again.
That belief lasted till the start of October.
Around Diwali, she started talking to me less. I noticed it, but I brushed it off thinking she might be busy because of the festive season. But frustration was building inside me. There was this guy she talked to very nicely, and whenever I tried the same, it always turned into fights or arguments. I got jealous and angry, and I kept bottling everything up.
On the night of 29 October, it all came out. I told her how I did not like the way she talked to him, why I was not getting priority, everything. We had a huge fight, and that is when she made it clear that it was over.
I want to make this very clear. It was not because of that guy.
That night almost killed me 🤣. I finally understood all the pain my friends went through after their breakups. I used to think kitna hi dard hota hoga, they are just overreacting. Turns out, they were not.
After the breakup came the begging, the denial, the promises, everything. She was angry at me because now I was doing all this when it was already too late.
The truth is, I became emotionally unavailable after she moved away. Going from sitting together every day to meeting once in 3–4 months for just an hour broke me completely. I never processed it. To deal with that pain, I shut my emotions down. That made me emotionally unavailable.
An emotionally unavailable guy with a sensitive girl is the worst combination possible.
She waited for almost a year for me to get better emotionally, to understand her, and to support her. I failed again and again. Eventually, she gave up.
Even in November, we were still in contact, not like before obviously. I was living alone at that time and struggling badly with panic attacks, anxiety, fear, and honestly, suicidal thoughts. I begged her not to cut contact completely. I know many people will say we should have cut contact for both our sake, and I agree. But when it is your time, you do not do what is right, you do what keeps you alive.
During that time, she told me she always felt frustrated talking to me because she never felt understood. She did not want to put in effort anymore, whether you call it a relationship, situationship, or friendship.
In this entire year, we met only once, on 19 April. Even that meeting happened mainly because she had other work to do that day, not entirely because of me. That hurt, but I understood it. By then, she was already emotionally done.
I even made her promise that if she ever started liking someone in the future, she would tell me. I never expected that promise to actually be fulfilled.
Yesterday, she told me she likes someone. Yes, the same guy I mentioned earlier. She admires him, and he likes her too. I had a panic attack reading that 🤣🤣, but honestly, I kind of expected it.
She asked me what she should do. I genuinely thought of telling her that it was just a replacement, that she was not ready, and that her emotions were not real yet.
But I did not.
I told her to go for it. I wished her well. I gave her my blessing, even though it was killing me from inside. I am not a saint, but I do not know why I did that.
It hurts to know you are replaced. It hurts knowing she has moved on.
And please do not say anything bad about her. She did not cheat. We technically broke up in May, and she was not even friends with this guy back then. She did not leave me for him.
This is the end.
It was beautiful while it lasted. I will always cherish those moments with her. I will miss her.
And to all the boys reading this, please do not make the mistakes I did. Compliment your girl. Love her, and actually show it. Take care of her emotionally. Cherish it while you can.

But nahh bro😭 it wasn’t. Two days ago, when I was in the bathroom around 11 at night, I again heard the sound of anklets. I thought it must be my mom, so I called her 4–5 times, but there was no response I got so scared that I quickly finished what I was doing and went straight to sleep
The most terrifying part is that yesterday, when I was alone at home i again heard the sound of anklets and felt like someone was actually staring at me. This time, I was so scared that I decided to go downstairs to my neighbor aunty place until my mom came back from the market iswitched off all the lights, locked the door, and only returned home once my mom was back.
And you won’t believe what I saw lights were on, fans were running, and the bedsheet was messed up like someone had been lying on it when I told my family about it, they said it might be my grandmother (mind you, my grandmother passed away during covid and due to the lockdown, we couldn’t go to our village for her last rites )They had also noticed similar things before but never thought it could be her spirit.Later after asking a few ppls i found out that ghosts do exist in the form of bad spirits
Also one more thing I forgot to mentionwhen I heard the anklet sound in the bathroom I tried to recite the hanuman Chalisa, but I started stammering. I still can’t believe how I couldn’t even read after one verse even though I’ve been reciting it for the past 5–7 years so yeah that was the whole story.You guys can also share your paranormal experiences",https://i.redd.it/vtsa8u92mpvf1.jpeg

She didn't have her periods from past two months and then she did pregnancy test. Firstly there were two lines appearing but one was very light, she wasn't sure (ik she's stupid) so she wasn't really serious about it. She took medicine to get periods but it wasn't working then she discussed this topic with me, said she and her bf are having sex 2-3 times a week and using condom. I told her she should do another test just after she wakes up And if she is pregnant she should go to gynecologist immediately and do abortion, Earlier the better. After that I discussed this topic with my mom as I thought I should take advice from some adult obviously I didn't disclosed her name. My mom wasn't really happy with this incident and told me to stay away from that girl. She said if her parents got to know it they can attempt suicide on the name of ""badnami"". And if anything happens to her health during abortion process the blame will be on me as I've given her advice to see the doctor without telling anyone. Now my friend is calling me, she wants me to talk with her boyfriend and tell him which doctor they should go. I was about to tell them one of gynec. Idk I should receive her call or not. I don't wanna leave my friend alone at this time but am very confused rn.

The result is mind blowing!!,"So I was not a sugar addict or even a fast food addict, but whenever I used to have some fast food or sugary stuff, then after that, I used to feel guilty to what I did. I felt concerned about my health especially my skin. I am really protective towards my skin, but I heard that eating fast food and products made of sugar can make your skin uneven and and basically ugly, so I started watching YouTube videos related to how can I maintain a better skin health. I stumbled upon a video titled -How leaving sugar can transform your whole face.
I started a month ago with a frown on my face because I knew I will continue this challenge for about a week and then I will quit it, but it was easier than I expected. There were some days when I  craved for sugary things, but however, I controlled it ,days passed by and Icould see some changes already. I also used to have beetroot 3 to 4 days in a week and trust me. It contains magical powers to enhance the glow of your face and makes it reddish . every day when I used to wake up in this challenge, I felt like a new person every day because I used to see changes inside me which was for a good reason and on top of that I never felt guilty for anything. I don’t want to waste your time by writing everything about my journey, but guys it’s totally worth it.

Like that. Like 100% confident tone.
Whole class went DEAD silent. Then everyone BURST out laughing. Even the teacher was shocked, but then just rolled her eyes and went “Get some sleep, Romeo 💀🥲
The worst part? Now everyone thinks I’ve got a secret girlfriend. Girls have been teasing me nonstop like “Who’s babe?” and “You got a secret girl or what?”
One junior girl literally DMed me on Insta asking “So who’s the lucky girl?” I replied “you?” and she just sent a skull emoji.
I swear I might’ve unintentionally created my own dating rumor.
Should I just roll with it or clear things up?",

I pity you all,"Not all but most of you are so pathetic and downright desperate. You have literally zero self esteem and will jump in any user’s dm if you realize she’s a girl. You guys are so pathetic you will give thousands of upvotes just by reading the letter “F” in the post.
You will write paragraphs long comments trying to help a user posting about something they are suffering (condition required = user shoul be a girl), guy posted about his mental health? Ma chuda bhai tu, hum toh jaake simping karenge, simping karke ladki reply karegi, fir uske dm me jayenge. You assholes don’t know that girls hate, with all their soul, desperate guys like you. And that’s the reason why most of you guys are loner.
You are desperate, simp, no self respect or self esteem, if we ask what is your type in guys to a girl, notice how they say so many things? and that’s how it should be. But when you ask a guy what’s his type, most of you all gonna say “ladki hini chahiye, zinda..” chup reh madarchod, isiliye bhaw nahi deta tujhe koi, kyuki tere expectations nahi hai, fir jab kat ta hai tab rr karega, ladki ko gaali dega, the girl is not at fault, tu chutiya tha
Kutte ki dum ke tarah ladki ke piche bhagte ho and that too any random girl that posted or commented with “F”
Pathetic, absolutely pathetic, i pity you all, daya aati hai tum logo ko dekh ke. ik ye sab bolne ke baad bhi change nahi hoge, good for me, mere liye competition kam kar rahe, karo bhar bhar ke simping aur dikhao desperation aur self esteem kam karo bkl karo
(ladka hu mai bhi mc, “F” dekh ke chale aaye na?)",
