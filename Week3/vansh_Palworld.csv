I’ve always been one of the ones that’s aware the world of Pokémon is a lot darker than the games and mainline TV show let on. I’ve watched Beloved Pokémon get shot in the face. Dead. I’ve seeing team rocket poaching slowpokes and unlike in the game they didn’t stop at cutting off the tail.
The reason all the adults in the game are afraid of fighting team rocket, while a 10-year-old beats the shit out of them is because the adults live in a world where team rocket will shoot you and your Pokémon mid battle the only reason you win is plot armor.
This game has all that I feel like I’ve been trapped on a lost island of Pokémon with all the proper dangers of wild Pokémon. There’s survivors and half of them have formed a team much like rocket
Here  is hoping Nintendo’s lawsuit fails because honestly I see way more than just Pokémon in this game. If they ripped off anything they took 20 different games and smashed them into one I see parts of Fortnite arc Pokémon mostly and tidbits taken from other games here and there like the shape of the world being similar to that of Elden ring .",https://i.redd.it/ibhl2c05jtec1.jpeg

It gave me the same sense of wonder and engagement I got from playing similar games on my Gameboy back when I was a kid. For a while, I was just running around doing everything on my own, figuring it out as I could and got to about level 30.
Then, once the first resource wall hit and I had to travel irl, I started looking up YouTube videos and tips. Which turned into looking up guides and best pals and once I got home I started following them. Little by little the game lost all it's wonder it became like every other game where I was following the optimal route, optimal building techniques to get past the grinds quicker.
Next thing you know, I inevitable spoiled who the legendaries are, bosses and everything in between. I'm still only level 40 and still seeing new pals out in the world, but it's not longer playing for fun now its just breeding optimal pals, capturing a ton for exp and moving on to next area.
I'm doing solo with default server settings and unfortunately my brain that's been trained to be meta oriented and efficiency oriented has somewhat ruined the end game.
TLDR: If you're just starting out, enjoy your first playthrough slowly because once you spoil it, there's no going back.",
