There is a misconception that I tend to see too many times: that Kratos didn't know how to be a father. That's simply not true. Perhaps it's the product of many people entering through the Norse games (like myself) and making assumptions.
Kratos already knows how to father. He was openly affectionate to his first child, Calliope. He made her flute, visits her in bed, and speaks to her gently.
Then come Atreus in GoW 2018, Kratos was harsh, distant and dismissive. Kratos was barely in Atreus life that the child believed his father didn't want him.
I've seen people poke fun and joke about the difference of his treatment of his son compared to his daughter. While the memes are funny, I still want to tackle them in serious discussion.
The difference between Spartan Kratos and Norse Kratos.
I won't elaborate much since this is common knowledge. Spartan Kratos with Calliope was a successful man, arguably happy. He had no reason to put on a mask or be distant with his daughter.
Norse Kratos was severely traumatised of causing Calliope's death. His sins caused him self loathing, including his own nature as a god.
Kratos believed his son was better off with little of his involvement. This distance caused their relationship to be strained and awkward at the beginning of the game.
Calliope is a girl and Atreus is a boy.
Yes, I believe this actually matters. Kratos is raised in a society where boys were taken from their mothers to be trained as soldiers. The male upbringing that Kratos knew was that of blind obedience to superiors, competition, violence and discipline.
It's undeniable Kratos' childhood experiences shaped his treatment of Atreus. But in Ragnarok, Kratos admits he did not train Atreus the Spartan way because it was unnecessarily harsh.
While Calliope was initially deemed too weak to pass Spartan standards, once she was healthy there was no expectation for her to become a soldier.
Atreus inherited the things Kratos hated: godhood and rage.
Kratos' desire to impart discipline on Atreus is motivated by love. His rage was destructive and could bring horrible consequences. Kratos spent more than a century bringing his rage under control and desperately wanted to pass this knowledge down to Atreus.
However, of course, this was severely complicated by Kratos not wanting Atreus to learn he was a god, and we already know the consequence (the sickness).
While Calliope also had some kind of sickness (perhaps the same nature as Atreus) and also a goddess, it didn't seem to manifest into a form of rage. Kratos did not have the same drive and need to discipline his daughter.
Kratos saw a simpler future for Calliope, while Atreus' was unclear to him.
With Calliope, the most important job of Kratos would just be to find her suitable husband in Sparta. Ironically, Calliope never had this future. We never had a chance to see if she would ever defy the role led out for her, or if she would follow it wholeheartedly.
In Ragnarok, one the causes of the conflict between father and son was Atreus looking to find his identity and destiny. Kratos could not give his son answers, and all he could provide was training, discipline and protection. Atreus had begun to reject these in favor of independence, action and taking risks.
Despite claiming to not believe in a death prophecy, Kratos was hard on Atreus knowing that one day he might not be there for him.
However, this same uncertainty seemed to have given Kratos a way to appreciate the present. As we learn in the quest with the Hafgufas, Kratos simply wanted to enjoy time with his son while he still could.

That scar is never mentioned, they never talk about it, no one in the game even notices the scar and what it is supposed to be. 
We never learn the official story behind it, but through his dialogues and just by observing their relationship, you can tell that Atreus, as a child, was so affected by Kratos's emotional distance and lack of affection, he was so in need of getting his father's approval... that he carved on his own face Kratos's tattoo pattern to ""be more like him"" so he would like him.
