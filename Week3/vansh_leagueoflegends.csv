While there are varying opinions of him floating around the internet he was an entertainer like no other who loved gaming with every fiber of his being.
While he took a look at League in its infancy (Source:
https://youtu.be/Z_78J6FEouM
) he gained enough referrals to receive an item named after him. The Total Biscuit of Rejuvenation now known as the Total Biscuit of Everlasting Will. 
(Source:

In a way, through this game we all play he lives on, and the sincerest condolences go out to the work that he did and to his family.
Rest in peace John Peter Bain, may your soul find rest.

Throughout the entire game he goes on about how bad his teammates are and that the way they play should be bannable. All while being 2/8 before ending 2/11.
After this he bans 20+ people from his chat after he went over the vod and asked twitch chat who's fault that game was and they responded 'you'.
How is this guy not indefinitely banned? All of this happened while streaming to his young, impressionable fan base.
Edit: For the people asking for
a clip of him afking
. Sat in base while his team wanted to keep playing. Unfortunately I can't get a clip from the stream because vods are sub only. Would like to add that he had said earlier in the stream that he would have afked earlier if he wasn't streaming.",
leagueoflegends,https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/h9hxzf/im_almost_43_i_just_hit_gold_and_i_have_no_one_to/,42319,1651,"I'm almost 43, I just hit Gold, and I have no one to tell it to.","TL;DR: I'm old but Gold.
I've been playing League for over nine years now, and the dream always was to be above average. It's not a big dream, but there you go.
When we still had ELO, that meant being above 1200 (I never was). As soon as we had the ranked system, I wanted to be Gold. That's where the shiny borders are. That's where you get skins. That's where you can tell people you're actually kinda decent at this game.
The problem always was that I suck. My already non-existent mechanical skills managed to deteriorate even further after I hit 40. I also can't play every day, since my family and my job come first. And there's always too much happening on the screen for me to follow. I regularly confuse my own character with one of my teammates. I'm incapable of outplaying anyone.
So what I do is play braindead champions in the toplane, disable chat, ward as much as possible, bash towers whenever I can, and let the young folk carry me.
This afternoon it finally happened. I goofed around on Garen a bit while my Draven killed everyone and everything, and at the end of that game I was Gold. I'm absolutely ecstatic, but no one I know plays League. In fact, everyone I know thinks I'm a bit of a twat to still play videogames at my age. But to me this is a big thing.
So there you go. And I'm pretty sure if I can do this, any one of you can too!",

So I will try to keep this anonymous as possible, though it's quite hard given my current situation. I've been playing League of Legends for 6 years under the alias Squid Corona - squids are my favourite animal and Corona, believe it or not, is my real life surname.
As I'm sure everyone is well aware, there is a global pandemic called COVID-19 or, as very inconveniently for me, better known as Coronavirus. Trust me, I've heard all the jokes possible from friends and co-workers.
At the start of 2019 I managed to change my in-game name to just ""Corona"" as I thought the shorter version of my name was nicer, worked well with telling my real life friends to add me on League, as they all know it's my surname and I think Corona is a cool name so why not have just that. I had to use one of those third party sites to check the name and stay up till midnight in order to secure my family name in League (as a side note, Riot should really consider implementing a bot-detect system to stop name sniping).
I'm by most descriptions a casual player - I play one or two games a day of normal draft pick, almost always with friends just as a way of relaxing after work. On the 1st of April, I try to login to be greeted with a message telling me I need to change my name in order to proceed. I thought it was amusing at first, as almost every game a player would say in chat ""nice name"" to me, but I just shrugged my shoulders and emailed Riot in the hopes of them agreeing that it was a funny situation, and my name would be white-listed.
After two weeks of back and forth with multiple ""Player Support Specialists"", I was told that they had come to the conclusion that my name would not get white-listed and that I would have to change it if I wanted to keep playing League of Legends.
This is specially stupid since in other regions, players with the name Corona are still active and playing.
This to me is all very disappointing. I haven't chosen the name ""Corona"" for any reason, and certainly haven't done it during the covid-19 outbreak. I feel like Riot are just sticking a big middle finger to me and telling me that my family name is inappropriate to be a part of their game. I'm posting this to reddit because I want to know if the community really feels offended by the summoner name ""Corona"", or if I'm right in feeling a mild rage and sense of unfairness.

And a comment brought to my attention that he intentionally lost 16 games in a row to get to play in this rank so i went and checked it my self
So i Opened op.gg and searched the name of the account he was playing on in the video ""ProfessorIRONxd"" and geuss what there where no account with this name
So i searched the name of his jungler playing zac ""Wreck It Ralph**""** And found the game that had the fed akali in it , which is his only zac game go check it if u want
https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Wreck+It+Ralph
And i found out that he changed the account name to ""reeeeeeent"" Right after he finished making this video his op.gg
https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=reeeeeeent
and if u check this op.gg  ur gonna find that the last 3 games played where akali games that he won (last one played is the one in the video) but before that all of the other games is him going 0/8 ,0/13  etc for 16 games in a row
Now Tell me is it ok for a player for ruin the experince of 70 players just to make a youtube video styling on low elo player?

After a long day on the ranch, I pour myself a tall glass of milk, huff some paint, and log on to the Dell I got for Christmas in 2006 with Windows XP to play some League of Legends.
The client needs to patch. That's fine. I reheat a bowl of beans and lard for supper, and it's already at 13% by the time I get back, well ahead of schedule. I huff some more paint to pass the time, and oh boy does it pass. The client is ready to go by 7:30. Everybody keeps saying it's laggy, but I don't notice any difference from usual. Maybe I'm just too intelligent, or maybe the paint is finally doing its job.
I queue up solo - normal blind pick of course. The queue pops, and Clippy asks me if I want help selecting my champion. Not now not ever, I think boastfully at the cartoon paper clip. I lock in Dr. Munro. My teammates pick Shaco and all the others pick hot anime girls. I take one last good long huff to get ready for the game, and in we go.
The first thing I notice is that their team doesn't have a dt Munford. Free win then. I go top lane. I always go top lane. They have a Aatrod. Pathetic. I hit the minions. I miss some crepes bc I have 450 ping. Aatrox tries ro hit me but I heal up bc I'm drMindoro.
Midgame I have sunfire and I tp botlane to gank. They have thst new champ Aphelios shootijg weird bubble guns at me. There's a tirret or sometbjng? Idk anuway I kill him by running at his face pressing e amd right clicking him to death. I miss all three cleavers I throw. It doesn't matter.
20 min latr a D really stsrting to feel the paint. I have sjnfire warmogd spirit vosage and tp to baroj for teamfigyt. Aphekios knows he's dead as soon as tp channle starts. He tries to get away by rooting me or sokething? Idk anyway I press ult and run him down. I forgot ti buy boots. It doesnt matter. I get four kills by pressijg e and right ckickijg with my w on. Thst bitch Lux stole my penta.
Game ocer. Another win for Dr mubdo. So in concolustn, hello fellow summoner. This you should just play mondarb against aphelios. He kill gun guy good. Thank you. Thank you. If you kill gun man, anime grliss hot. they'll be lower son. The Dr mildew play is right thing to do. So doooooo",

I'm gay. I've struggled with my personal identity my entire life. While my parents were working in China, I moved around a lot from homestay to homestay, which is basically where you live in a stranger's home. At the age of 8, I was bombarded with homophobic and sexist remarks at home, and whenever I did something that wasn't ""manly,"" I was told, ""Why are you acting like a girl?"" and to stop being ""gay."" I was hyper-conscious of how I should act and tried not to act or sound ""gay,"" but I was still constantly bullied at school for it. No child should have to feel like they don't belong. Working in the video game industry hasn't helped matters either. On almost every team I've been on, I've heard homophobic comments from either my teammates or the staff and felt uncomfortable, even borderline afraid of possibly losing my job if I told the truth. I'm at a point in my life where I've accepted who I am, and it's taken me a long time to get there. My story is not unique. The gaming industry is rampant with sexism, prejudice, and homophobia. I don't believe there's a quick fix, but it starts with us holding ourselves to a higher standard and treating everyone with dignity. We need to educate people in esports of proper conduct within the workplace. I'm not making this announcement because I owe everyone the details of my personal life, but because I want there to be more awareness about the problems our community faces. Thank you to my parents and friends who have made me feel like I belong. You the real ones.",
leagueoflegends,https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/mw8kfy/goodbye_league_a_brief_love_letter_from_a/,31588,1054,"Goodbye, League: A brief love letter from a visually impaired player","I was not expecting today to be any different in terms of big life changes, it's really just a Thursday, pandemic seems to be easing up a little... But this morning, as I was playing draft pick, I understood something very painful: It was the last time I would play League of Legends.
I have been experiencing a very sudden process of sight loss due to untreated glaucoma since April 2020 that culminated in me hitting the threshold for legal blindness last December. All throughout the process, I kept playing League, as it was legitimately my favorite game and I had so much fun playing, but the past three months or so have been incredibly taxing, emotionally. I was playing more sporadically because even 15 minutes of straining my eyes leaves me with a migraine, but the more time that went between matches, the more noticeable my sight loss became whenever I logged in and sat for 30 minutes watching my gameplay worsen, the information slowly becoming something I could not parse. It was obviously not just the migraines, but the solidification of the fact that, well, fuck, I am going blind.
I know the community has a reputation for being jaded and toxic, and to an extent, I did get splashes of that experience, but honestly? My experience as a player was overwhelmingly positive. League was something for me to bond over with my real life friends, and a gateway to kind communities where I got to know online friends that would come to matter more to me than words could express. It was rewarding, I could see myself improve with practice, even if I never aimed for a high rank, and sitting down every night to play a few hours was the only thing that kept me going in what have been, quite frankly, a shit couple of years. When I think of League it's never the bad matches that stick with me, it's the neat outplays, the honest conversations about life in voice chat, the delight that came with messing around with builds and meeting people that I had this in common with.
Today was the day the loss finally hit. I was playing a Lux match, and understanding that even with my main, even with the more contrasting skin I could find, and all the color settings adjusted, and a giant monitor with a magnifier could not do anything about the fact that I just could not play because I could not see anything relevant. No abilities, no health bars, no indicators... My lack of peripheral vision also meant that all my attempts at hitting anything were mostly guesswork. Hell, the only reason I knew who I even was playing was the color of the blurry HP bar that took up a quarter of my monitor.
I don't think I can kid myself anymore into thinking that things will remain the same even as this huge part of my life changes into something unknown and terrifying. I hate that League of all things was what made me understand how real and irreversible the sight loss is, but it is what it is. So today, I have decided that I have played my last game of League. I did not savor it. I did not prep a goodbye party, and if this is a goodbye speech then it's kind of shitty.
I would still like to make use of this cheesy word vomit to thank League players and the team behind the game. You've brought many things to my life that I hope will remain now that League is no longer in it, and I am grateful. Regardless of what comes next, I will remember these times in my life fondly, and that's pretty much invaluable.
Thank you, it's been great. See you on the flip side.",

Overall timeline
Streamer got sniped by 4 people. 2 in her team(Nasus, Jhin) and 2 in the enemy team(Evelynn, Senna)
Can't end game by voting surrender since you cannot get the numbers
Nasus and Jhin cleared minions to prevent the nexus from being destroyed
Senna and Evelynn prevented her from doing backdoor(Nasus and Jhin tell them where she is)
Game goes on for over 3 hours. Death count of streamer was over 120
Streamer got banned 14 days by riot (snipers reported her by negative attitude and intentional feeding). Some say why not just leave the game, but she would've got banned for afk then.",

""Players are overplaying Swain and reaching ranks that they were not intended to. We want to be clear that the decision to restrict Swain games is an action taken to protect lower-ranked players from themselves. Do they want to end up in Platinum? Diamond? Above? We know they really don't want to be in the big pond with the big fish, and this action is taken to prevent exactly that. Swain is a meme pick--we recommend gold players and below actually perform their due diligence by listening to their overlords, the mega hot streamers and diamond youtube content creators.
""...the limit of three games will be imposed until Swain's winrate has returned to normal. Thank you for understanding!""
As well, players silver and below will no longer be allowed to play Rammus. Highly respected and diamond-ranked coach BaldBaby92 claims that this move will ""stop the plebes from ruining my games, or taking Swain from me in Champ Select.""

leagueoflegends,https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/hyr8dn/red_side_cannon_minions_have_20_lower_attack/,28279,1161,"Red Side Cannon Minions have 20 lower attack range than Blue Side ones (for 11 years, since Alpha)","I was writing a new wiki page about
unit size
the other day. One of the size modifiers that exists is Baron Buff, which only affects minions, but sure enough, this page was about non-champion sizes, too.
So after I set out to determine those modifiers, I also wanted to confirm the attack range increases on the Baron Buff page, which I asked a friend to get me. For the Cannon Minions, he returned '1050/1030 total range'.
I looked at those 2 values the same way you are right now. Nope, this isn't about other minions on any separate map; these are SR cannon minions. The Blue Cannon has 300 attack range; The Red Cannon only has 280 range!
As it turned out, this has been a bug since the earliest builds of the game we have access to; all the way back from Alpha! Minions are coded as separate units for both sides of the map; So are skins, technically, albeit they properly draw from the same data file for the gameplay side (the only differences are tags like 'human' and 'freljord' which VO interactions use). Same types of minions...do not draw from the same file. Not a big problem, though, as they only have to get a few values right? Yes, in theory, that isn't a big problem.
Unfortunately, in the game right now,
this
is an excerpt the Blue Cannon Minion data file
, and
this is the same excerpt in the data for the Red Cannon minion
. apart from the Name ID's, notice a difference?
And indeed, in the game, these minions adhere to those range values.
[If you make 2 opposing cannons run into each other without interference, they'll not always start attacking each other at the same time like same-ranged units would](see *Edit below for why this link is missing) - instead the Blue Minion goes first a lot of times. The reason it doesn't happen always is that 'is my enemy in attack range yet' is checked only so often, which is also why attacking an enemy moves your champion slightly closer than their attack range would require most of the time. Some would argue that that is to aid in chasing/orb-walking, but I don't think it was set up with that in mind. In any case, attack pathfinding at least doesn't path you into Dragon pit if you want to attack someone on the other side of that wall that is in range of Dragon pit at the time, which would be dumb.
Edit: I got some help in re-doing the proof for this:
Using Syndra W, we can get exact range values and eliminate the
'is my enemy in attack range yet' check
by throwing the minion straight from inside its range to slightly further than it was before. If it attacks without walking, it's inside its attack range; If it nudges forward first, it was thrown further than it's attack range.
Test with Blue Cannon
|
Test with Red Cannon
Here is a
comparison for the longest throw at which the minion doesn't nudge forward (= is still in attack range) at.
The difference isn't large (it's about 5% of attack range against a normal-sized champion), but you can see it
via the cursor location.
Also,
there's a Ryze bug that made separating these minions kinda annoying yet kind of fun.
This is the reason you canot port a single Rift Herald, or a single minion period, btw (first minion takes last ported champion's position, or won't get a new location at all if no champion was ported).
I tried showing off this difference in the one patch where the new HUD showed unit ranges in the collapsed version (5.14),
however minions all show as 0-ranged anyway due to ((bug))
. Which is sad, maybe someone would have noticed it then already!
The fact that blue team seems to generally win when the game is left alone by players entirely might be due to this bug. Blue team also has a higher winrate overall in the game, which is often attributed to the assymetry in HUD and the map, which is reasonable, but I wonder what the impact of this bug has been on that winrate, afterall.
*Edit: Turns out the mentioned tickrates make this way too hard, and upon reviewing the best clip I have, it has minion damage increase due to my target dummies leveling up, so
I'll remake this for you with a proof that's less up-to chance.
Edit2: Remade proof. Now definitive. See above.
TL:DR
:
Spot the difference
Edit: Would you believe it, turns out this bug is LITERALLY fixed on PBE this cycle already. I did all this confirmation work for naught. Well, at least we know the fix will be in 10.16 (next full patch), most likely!",

All he talked about was League and I had never played a computer game in my life. I did not understand why he couldn't just stop mid-game when I needed him to. I did not understand his love of esports. We were drifting apart.
So, I asked him to teach me how to play.
To say that it was a steep learning curve is an understatement. But I kept at it because I loved him. The more I understood about the game, the closer we got. After some disastrous games on Summoner's Rift (where I was rightly flamed for not knowing how to ping), I switched to just playing ARAM because it forced me to learn what all champions do. It was also more chill.
While I was never very good and never tried playing ranked, I understood enough to enjoy watching the LCK, MSI and Worlds. In 2019, my son and I travelled to Taiwan together to watch both of the semifinals of MSI. It is a memory that I will always cherish.
Now that he has grown up and left home, I don't play anymore but I am so grateful that I made the effort to understand the game he loved. Definitely worth.",

If I just abandon the game, I get punished for AFK but there's no other in-game thing I can do to stop being griefed? During this match there were four players who paired as two duos, popped into each other (now they control both teams ff's). By the time anybody realized what was happening, the duos were farmed enough to 2v3. So whenever a team went to end, they would communicate to their friends on the enemy team and prevent a team from ending the game.
I've learned that this is something they've planned and executed before:
https://twitter.com/mordeeasy2getlp/status/936469118097571840
and that Riot actually encountered this game and didn't look into any possibility of collusion. In fact, they arguably celebrated this here:

Here's their youtube upload of the prior colluded game:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahxwlzP0FX0
I just have no idea what i'meant to do against such organized and dedicated griefing. I can't submit a ticket, i'll just get told to report them in post-game and they do the usual nothing about a ticketed complaint. So I need to get to end screen to report them. Oh btw, the client has bugged on end screen and i'm stuck at ""skip waiting for stats"" so now I can't even report them.",

My friend said he will offer $10 worth of Riot points to recruit Dardoch for our clash since we really want that trophy. Our current jungler is silver 3 but doesn't mind subbing out for Dardoch since 5 is the limit and we have not yet won a Clash tournament.",
