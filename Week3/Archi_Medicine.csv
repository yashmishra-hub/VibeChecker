Medicine,https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/qzu1rc/a_detailed_description_of_how_you_die_from_covid/,8052,599,A detailed description of how you die from COVID in the ICU,"Good morning.
I squeeze your hand.
“It’s Friday at 9 o’clock in the morning.” I look out the window. “Gloomy day. It rained last night.”
You say nothing, because you’re chemically paralyzed and deeply sedated. All the drugs in the world to keep you from trying to breathe. My machine does it much better than you ever will.
I look over the fingers on your left hand. They’re falling off. You’re so sick that I was forced to choose your brain and your bowels to get blood instead of your fingers and toes.
Later that day, I take a long camera and put it down the tube breathing for you. I need to get some of the mucous in your lungs out. I quietly apologize for moving around your tube. It’s in your neck now, a surgically created hole, because the tube in your mouth caused your tongue to bleed. Your heart rate on the monitor shoots up. You’re paralyzed, but this is hurting you. I can tell by your heart rate. I ask your nurse for more medications to drip through your IVs. Please go back to sleep.
I watch your nurse troubleshoot your new kidneys. Except it’s a machine, your kidneys, because they stopped working from the weeks of toxins I gave you to try to keep you alive.
I’m not sure, but you probably don’t know who you are anymore. Your brain is so confused by the forced paralysis, the forced sleep, the inability to think, that you’ve become lost. Who are you?
Your family wants you to live, as every loved one wants for their person, so every day I watch your body die a little more. Every day I add a new medication to stave off the inevitable. A new side effect. You haven’t had a bowel movement in weeks. Your body is starving.
Eventually, your immune system and your body can’t fight off the bacteria living in your own body, your own skin, the normal things in the air. The bacteria take hold. They start using your blood to grow. They fill up your lungs with their damage. I add more medications.
I watch your last weeks alive. I watch your organs fail. I watch your fingers fall off. I watch your skin stop being able to protect your muscles and fat and just wear away in places. I watch your last few weeks alive, not knowing who you are, forcefully keeping you asleep. I hope you don’t feel this.
In 25 days, I will tell your family that despite every possible forceful thing I can do to keep you alive, your last little bit is now dying too. It might be your heart, starved for oxygen and trying so hard to keep up that it finally couldn’t squeeze any more. It might be your brain, where weeks of dying finally gave you a stroke.
If they’re kind, your family will tell me to keep you asleep and let you die. If they don’t believe me, I will spend my last moments with you watching someone crack every rib in your chest. A demand to your broken body that I can no longer demand. Stay alive.
I am angry for you. I am angry someone lied to you. I am angry that you were taken advantage of, for reasons I will never understand.
If you have not been vaccinated against COVID-19, this is how you die from it.
Please reconsider. You are wrong. Please give the small part of you that whispers, maybe I have been lied to, give it a chance.
Do not die like this.

So I went through each disease for which the child would be vaccinated today.
I told them about diphtheria and the 30% mortality rate, how diphtheria toxin is one of the most toxic substances known, as a single molecule can kill a cell.  I told them about how this disease use to terrify communities.
They'd already heard of tetanus.  Everyone has heard of tetanus.
I told them about pertussis and the baby I saw who coughed and coughed and coughed and coughed and coughed...until he went into laryngospasm.  We did everything we could.  I will never forget his mother throwing herself at our feet begging us to not say what we were going to say.  I let that family see the tears playing in my eyes as I described the memory.  They needed to know that I am doing this
because I fucking care.
Not because of some quality metric.
We'd already discussed how hepatitis B is spread by nonsexual transmission and how in the prevaccine era, as many as 65% of infants born to HBV positive
fathers
had HBV by the tme they were a year old.  We talked about how that is a life sentence before age 1.
They know about polio.
I talked about the baby I watched die of pneumococcal sepsis.  Another mother at our feet.  Another family destroyed by a microbe.
I described a cricoidotomy in graphic detail.
I was admitted for rotavirus in February of 1979.  I still have the hospital bill for $20.  My mother told me about how sick I was.  And 25 years later, I became a resident and I saw babies with rotavirus.  You could hear the diarrhea from across the emergency department.  We had to do our own IVs at the NYC hospital.  The babies were just so sick and all we could do was keep them hydrated and wait for them to recover.  And then in the fall of 2006 the rotavirus vaccine came out.  And in February of 2008 I was the senior on the floor and... there weren't any rotavirus kids.  It was just gone.
And I asked that mother, now that she'd asked me which vaccines were important, I was going to turn the questions around.  Which ones did
she
think were important?
That baby got every recommended immunization today.   I won.  RFJ Jr. lost.  The parents won; that mother won't be throwing herself at my feet.
Most importantly, the baby won.

Medicine,https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ff8hns/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/,4163,510,"Testimony of a surgeon working in Bergamo, in the heart of Italy's coronavirus outbreak","«In one of the non-stop e-mails that I receive from my hospital administration on a more than daily basis, there was a paragraph on ""how to be responsible on social media"", with some recommendations that we all can agree on. After thinking for a long time if and what to write about what's happening here, I felt that silence was not responsible. I will therefore try to convey to lay-people, those who are more distant from our reality, what we are experiencing in Bergamo during these Covid-19 pandemic days. I understand the need not to panic, but when the message of the danger of what is happening is not out, and I still see people ignoring the recommendations and people who gather together complaining that they cannot go to the gym or play soccer tournaments, I shiver. I also understand the economic damage and I am also worried about that. After this epidemic, it will be hard to start over.
Still, beside the fact that we are also devastating our national health system from an economic point of view, I want to point out that the public health damage that is going to invest the country is more important and I find it nothing short of ""chilling"" that new quarantine areas requested by the Region has not yet been established for the municipalities of Alzano Lombardo and Nembro (I would like to clarify that this is purely personal opinion). I myself looked with some amazement at the reorganization of the entire hospital in the previous week, when our current enemy was still in the shadows: the wards slowly ""emptied"", elective activities interrupted, intensive care unit freed to create as many beds as possible. Containers arriving in front of the emergency room to create diversified routes and avoid infections. All this rapid transformation brought in the hallways of the hospital an atmosphere of surreal silence and emptiness that we did not understand, waiting for a war that had yet to begin and that many (including me) were not so sure would never come with such ferocity (I open a parenthesis: all this was done in the shadows, and without publicity, while several newspapers had the courage to say that private health care was not doing anything).
I still remember my night shift a week ago spent without any rest, waiting for a call from the microbiology department. I was waiting for the results of a swab taken from the first suspect case in our hospital, thinking about what consequences it would have for us and the hospital. If I think about it, my agitation for one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified, now that I have seen what is happening. Well, the situation is now nothing short of dramatic. No other words come to mind. The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night. One after the other, these unfortunate people come to the emergency room. They have far from the complications of a flu. Let's stop saying it's a bad flu. In my two years working in Bergamo, I have learned that the people here do not come to the emergency room for no reason. They did well this time too. They followed all the recommendations given: a week or ten days at home with a fever without going out to prevent contagion, but now they can't take it anymore. They don't breathe enough, they need oxygen. Drug therapies for this virus are few.
The course mainly depends on our organism. We can only support it when it can't take it anymore. It is mainly hoped that our body will eradicate the virus on its own, let's face it. Antiviral therapies are experimental on this virus and we learn its behavior day after day. Staying at home until the symptoms worsen does not change the prognosis of the disease. Now, however, that need for beds in all its drama has arrived. One after another, the departments that had been emptied are filling up at an impressive rate. The display boards with the names of the sicks, of different colors depending on the department they belong to, are now all red and instead of the surgical procedure, there is the diagnosis, which is always the same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Now, tell me which flu virus causes such a rapid tragedy.
Because that's the difference (now I get a little technical): in classical flu, besides that it infects much less population over several months, cases are complicated less frequently: only when the virus has destroyed the protective barriers of our airways and as such it allows bacteria (which normally resident in the upper airways) to invade the bronchi and lungs, causing a more serious disease. Covid 19 causes a banal flu in many young people, but in many elderly people (and not only) a real SARS because it invades the alveoli of the lungs directly, and it infects them making them unable to perform their function. The resulting respiratory failure is often serious and after a few days of hospitalization, the simple oxygen that can be administered in a ward may not be enough. Sorry, but to me, as a doctor, it's not reassuring that the most serious are mainly elderly people with other pathologies. The elderly population is the most represented in our country and it is difficult to find someone who, above 65 years of age, does not take at least a pill for high blood pressure or diabetes.
I can also assure you that when you see young people who end up intubated in the ICU, pronated or worse, in ECMO (a machine for the worst cases, which extracts the blood, re-oxygenates it and returns it to the body, waiting for the lungs to hopefully heal), all this confidence for your young age goes away. And while there are still people on social media who boast of not being afraid by ignoring the recommendations, protesting that their normal lifestyle habits have ""temporarily"" halted, the epidemiological disaster is taking place. And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us.
The cases multiply, up to a rate of 15-20 hospitalizations a day all for the same reason. The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the emergency room is collapsing. Emergency provisions are issued: help is needed in the emergency room. A quick meeting to learn how the to use to emergency room EHR and a few minutes later I'm already downstairs, next to the warriors on the war front. The screen of the PC with the chief complaint is always the same: fever and respiratory difficulty, fever and cough, respiratory insufficiency etc ... Exams, radiology always with the same sentence: bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All needs to be hospitalized. Some already needs to be intubated, and goes to the ICU. For others, however, it is late. ICU is full, and when ICUs are full, more are created. Each ventilator is like gold: those in the operating rooms that have now suspended their non-urgent activity are used and the OR become a an ICU that did not exist before. I found it amazing, or at least I can speak for Humanitas Gavazzeni (where I work), how it was possible to put in place in such a short time a deployment and a reorganization of resources so finely designed to prepare for a disaster of this magnitude. And every reorganization of beds, wards, staff, work shifts and tasks is constantly reviewed day after day to try to give everything and even more. Those wards that previously looked like ghosts are now saturated, ready to try to give their best for the sick, but exhausted. The staff is exhausted. I saw fatigue on faces that didn't know what it was despite the already grueling workloads they had. I have seen people still stop beyond the times they used to stop already, for overtime that was now habitual. I saw solidarity from all of us, who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask ""what can I do for you now?"" or ""leave that admission to me, i will take care of it."" Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we are unable to save everyone and the vital signs of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny. There are no more shifts, schedules.
Social life is suspended for us. I have been separated for a few months, and I assure you that I have always done my best to constantly see my son even on the day after a night shift, without sleeping and postponing sleep until when I am without him, but for almost 2 weeks I have voluntarily not seen neither my son nor my family members for fear of infecting them and in turn infecting an elderly grandmother or relatives with other health problems. I'm happy with some photos of my son that I look at between tears and a few video calls. So you should be patient too, you can't go to the theater, museums or gym. Try to have mercy on that myriad of older people you could exterminate. It is not your fault, I know, but of those who put it in your head that you are exaggerating and even this testimony may seem just an exaggeration for those who are far from the epidemic, but please, listen to us, try to leave the house only to indispensable things. Do not go en masse to make stocks in supermarkets: it is the worst thing because you concentrate and the risk of contacts with infected people who do not know they are infected. You can go there without a rush. Maybe if you have a normal mask (even those that are used to do certain manual work), put it on. Don't look for ffp2 or ffp3. Those should serve us and we are beginning to struggle to find them. By now we have had to optimize their use only in certain circumstances, as the WHO recently recommended in view of their almost ubiquitous running low. Oh yes, thanks to the shortage of certain protection devices, many colleagues and I are certainly exposed despite all the other means of protection we have. Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols. Some infected colleagues also have infected relatives and some of their family members are already struggling between life and death. We are where your fears could make you stay away. Try to make sure you stay away.
Tell your family members who are elderly or with other illnesses to stay indoors. Bring him the groceries please. We have no alternative. It's our job. Indeed what I do these days is not really the job I'm used to, but I do it anyway and I will like it as long as it responds to the same principles: try to make some sick people feel better and heal, or even just alleviate the suffering and the pain to those who unfortunately cannot heal. I don't spend a lot of words about the people who define us heroes these days and who until yesterday were ready to insult and report us. Both will return to insult and report as soon as everything is over. People forget everything quickly. And we're not even heroes these days. It's our job. We risked something bad every day before: when we put our hands in a belly full of someone's blood we don't even know if they have HIV or hepatitis C; when we do it even though we know they have HIV or hepatitis C; when we stick ourselves during an operation on a patient with HIV and take the drugs that make us vomit all day long for a month. When we read with anguish the results of the blood tests after an accidental needlestick, hoping not to be infected. We simply earn our living with something that gives us emotions. It doesn't matter if they are beautiful or ugly, we just take them home. In the end we only try to make ourselves useful for everyone. Now try to do it too, though: with our actions we influence the life and death of a few dozen people. You with yours, many more. Please share and share the message. We need to spread the word to prevent what is happening here from happening all over Italy.»

Medicine,https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/4g8pf8/he_is_small_for_an_eightyearold_boy_made_even/,4088,624,"He is small for an eight-year-old boy, made even smaller by the big trauma room gurney beneath him...","He is small for an eight-year-old boy, made even smaller by the big trauma room gurney beneath him. Two skinny, sunburnt legs stick out from a pair of much too large, frayed, hand-me-down cutoffs. Green grass stains cover the skin of both knees. His bare feet are filthy, farm boy filthy. The kind of filthy that comes from playing in the cool dirt of an old barn floor, from running through uncut fields of wheat alongside the combines, and from climbing the giant hay bales that dot the rolling hills this time of year.
Two hours ago he was just another shirtless boy in a cowboy hat playing in the wheat.
His mother stands across from me. She is perhaps thirty-two. She has sandy blonde hair, just like the boy on the gurney. I can’t see her face because it is buried in her husband’s chest. She is completely silent but her whole body shakes, trembling like an old John Deere combine with something stuck in its blades. Her husband pulls her tight, his arms wrapping around her, trying to protect her from this place, this moment.
The two of them clutch to each other, here, in my emergency room.
At the head of the bed the ventilator chimes and puffs and clicks along as it pushes air into the boy. It pushes air into lungs that collapsed and now have chest tubes draining them. Lungs that cried out just loud enough to stop thirty thousand pounds of combine from turning the boy into chaff with the wheat.
The boy’s arm twitches. The nurse next to me blinks back tears and adjusts his IV.
A case like this is a bomb that detonates in our ER, in our town, in our lives. The shockwaves right now are spreading as neighbors call neighbors, as friends call friends, as family reaches out for family and parents run to check on their children. I know I will not be the only one unable to sleep tonight.
The father stares at his son on the gurney. His face is filled with questions for which I have no answers. How can this happen? How can something we love, something so full of life, be so fragile, so vulnerable, so easily cut down and taken from us in the blink of an eye?
He does not know it yet but he is now standing in a new life. A life that will always be different from the one he woke up to this morning.
I step over to the computer to order some more sedation for the boy while we wait for the helicopter. Taped above the screen is a brand new sign. It is a decal of five gold stars. It seems so out of place at a moment like this. The last few weeks the hospital has been putting them up everywhere. They are there to remind us to give ‘five-star’ service- to tell our patients how much we appreciate their business and hope they will choose us for their future healthcare needs.
They are to be called customers now, not patients, we are told.
Customers.
I tear it off the screen and wrinkle it in my hand into a ball, squeezing it tight. I shove it in the pocket of my white coat.
Twenty-two minutes later the whine of the helicopter engine fills the air as it prepares for takeoff. I stand outside with the father, watching the big blades spin up to speed in the late August light. Inside the helicopter there is room enough for only one parent to go with the boy. One hundred and three miles away a pediatric ICU bed is waiting.
The helicopter lifts off and a cloud of late summer dust fills the air. The father does not move as the debris cloud swirls about his head. Instead, he stares at the window on the side of the helicopter, the dark outline of his son just visible to us both.
We watch the helicopter rise above the pad and rotate slowly. It climbs a little further, hesitates in the air, and then races off above the wheat fields, the grains below bowing from the thrust of its blades.
I take out the five-star decal from my pocket, unfolding it carefully. I tear it in two and press the larger half against the brick wall behind us. I scribble my home phone number on the back.
“Let me know,” I say.
The father takes the paper and nods, still staring at the shrinking outline of the helicopter. At last it disappears over the mountains in the distance. He turns to me but his eyes are empty now. He is already departing, already arriving at the next place. We shake hands and he walks slowly off to his truck. He’s got a long, quiet drive to the city ahead of him.
I look down at what’s left of the ripped up decal in my hand.
The image of the boy burns bright in my mind. I know I will carry this day with me for a very long time.
I make a fist, crumpling the decal.
I respectfully disagree with those who want us to call them customers, healthcare consumers, or business opportunities.
The people we care for are sons and daughters. Mothers and fathers. Husbands and wives. They are neighbors, friends, and sometimes even colleagues.
They are people like you and me in a moment of need.
They are patients.
Addendum:
When I wrote this I thought maybe a couple dozen people would want to discuss it. I had no idea it would blow up like this. A couple short points:
I really appreciate everyone's comments and insights- from the administrators, to the patients, to others in healthcare. I have learned a great deal just from reading your posts and I hope others have too. Those of you who share your insights and experiences with others are truly the best of reddit.
To those determined to find and dox the boy in the story I say this: You are welcome to keep trying but you won't find him. Out of respect for my patients and because of HIPAA I always change enough details of anything I write in a way that makes it impossible to find the individual while staying true to what happened. I will say the original patient who inspired this story several years ago ended up fine.
To those of you who asked if I have written anything else I wrote a book of short stories about being an ER doc in a small town. It's here if you are interested.

I work in a small conservative rural town providing primary care exclusively to Medicaid patients.  I live in a big city 200 miles away and for the last five years, have commuted to this job to work M-W. The clinic I am at was stood up after the ACA’s Medicaid expansion to give patients a PCP instead of having them rely on frequent visits to the ER. I have loved this job.  I work three days a week.  The pay is great. I get to care for the poor and underserved.  I like to think I have made a pretty big difference in the community.
COVID has come with its stressors.  Being a small conservative community, I have heard every conspiracy theory possible about COVID. Everyday it is me trying to educate and push back against the misinformation.  Everyday is a fight to get people to wear masks (including coworkers). Everyday is a futile attempt to get people to get vaccinated.  I have a panel of a thousand patients and to my continuing horror, I have only been able to talk one patient that was on the fence into getting the vaccine.
I have vials of vaccines in the medication fridge ready to go but nobody to wants them.
Nobody believes COVID is real or a serious issue.  It is all a big “libtard” conspiracy. Yet this county has one of the highest infection rates in the state.
The supervising physician, the medical assistants, and the office manager are all unvaccinated. There is a second PA but they had a bad reaction to the first shot and never went back for the second. I am literally the only person in the organization that is fully vaccinated.  They have refused to get vaccinated and have had no plans to get vaccinated.  In fact, they have dissuaded patients out of getting the vaccine.  I keep working there despite this because I think I am doing good for my patients and the community and feel compelled to “fight the good fight.”
Last week, our governor announced a mandate that all teachers and healthcare workers get vaccinated (barring legitimate medical exemption).
Today, the office manager told me that they may have to close the clinic down because none of them are willing to get vaccinated. They would rather shut things down and abandon the patients and our service to the community than to “get the jab.”
I gave notice today.  I can’t work there anymore. I am at a point where the pay and perks aren’t enough. I can’t argue about it anymore. There is no educating or persuading.  I just can’t do it.
I have pretty much lost all faith in people.
Edit:
Wow.  Thank you for the support! Last night was a little raw. It was nice to wake up and read this.  Well... back to the clinic for a few more weeks. The grind goes on. :)",

6am - Wake up. Roll off of my pile of money that Big Pharma gave me. Softly weep as it doesn’t put a dent in my medical school loans
6:30am - Make breakfast, using only foods from the diet that gives me everlasting life by avoiding all fats, sugars, carbs, and proteins. For details buy my book and check out my shop.
7am - Get to work, load up my syringes with coronavirus before rounds.
8am - See my patients for the day. Administer the medications that the government tells me to. Covertly rub essential oils on the ones I want to get better.
9:30am - Call Bill Gates to check how 5G tower construction is going, hoping for more coronavirus soon. He tells me they’re delayed due to repairs on the towers used to spread the Black Plague. Curse the fact that this is the most efficient way to spread infectious diseases.
10am - One patient tells me he knows “the truth” about coronavirus. I give him a Tdap booster. He becomes autistic in front of my eyes. He’ll never conspire against me again.
11am - Tend to the secret hospital garden of St. John’s wort and ginkgo leaves that we save for rich patients and donors.
12:30pm - Pick up my briefcase of money from payroll, my gift from Pfizer for the incomprehensible profits we make off of the free influenza vaccine given every year.
1pm - Conference call with Dr. Fauci and the lab in Wuhan responsible for manufacturing viruses. Tell them my idea about how an apocalypse-style zombie virus would be a cool one to try for the next batch.
2pm - A patient starts asking me about getting rid of toxins. I ask her if she has a liver and kidneys. She tells me she knows “the truth” about Big Anatomy and that the only way to detoxify herself is to eat nothing but lemon wedges and mayonnaise for weeks. I give her a Tdap booster.
2:45pm - Help the FBI, CIA, and CDC silence the masses. Lament the fact that I can only infringe on one or two of their rights. Oh well, there’s always tomorrow.
4pm - One of my rich patients begins to crash. Laugh as I realize I’ve mismatched her spirit animal and zodiac moon sign. I switch out the Purple Amethyst above her bed for a Tiger’s Eye geode. She stabilizes. I throw some ginkgo leaves on her for good measure
6pm - Go onto YouTube and see coronavirus conspiracy videos everywhere. Curse my all powerful government for how inept they are at keeping people from spreading “the truth”
6:10pm - Go onto Amazon and see that a book about “the truth” is the #1 seller this week. Question the power of my all powerful government. Make a reminder to myself to get more Tdap boosters from the Surgeon General next time we talk.
7pm - Time to go home. Before I leave, sacrifice a goat to Dr. Fauci and say three Hippocratic Oaths.
9pm - Take a contented sigh as I snuggle under the covers made of the tinfoil hats of my enemies, realizing that my 4 years of medical school and 3 years of residency training have been put to good use today.

Sure, you had a health scare when you were in your mid 30s, a pretty big scare come to think of it. You had some chest pain whenever you worked too hard and went to a heart doctor and after a bunch of tests wound up getting some kind of mesh tube in your heart. Or something. Doesn't matter. You see your heart doctor every year and he tells you you're fine. Maybe lose a couple pounds. Here's a pill you should take for your blood pressure. Maybe you know the name of it, maybe you don't. But you still see your heart doctor, even two decades later, because you want to be healthy.
Your other doctor worries about your sugars. He tells you to take a different pill. Metformin. You know that one's name. Your other doctor also tells you to lose some weight. And he says he doesn't like how high this blood test number is. But you feel fine. It doesn't hurt like the chest pain you had.
Maybe you work at a gas station. Maybe you're a public notary, doesn't matter. You're definitely blue collar. Hair's thinning and mostly grey, you keep it buzzed pretty close to the scalp. You haven't shaven for the past week or so it seems, because you got sick.
You come down with the flu. Fevers that leave you sweating and chills that put you under the extra blankets you keep on the top shelf of your closet. You don't take a temperature though. You just feel awful. And the cough keeps you up at night. You're not coughing up any goo though, so that's good. Right?
You put up with it for a week. The fevers aren't going away. What's more worrying is that it's getting harder to breathe. Not the kind of hard to breathe when you had your heart issue, no, this is taking the wind from you when you walk the length of your room to go take a wiz. So you overcome your stubbornness and go to an Urgent Care.
This new doctor says he doesn't like the sound of your lungs and orders a chest Xray. Your new doctor says you have pneumonia and gives you two more pills to take. Antibiotics. They'll help you start breathing better again.
But you don't start breathing better. And the fevers only go away for a little when you take Tylenol. And you're having to breathe faster now even in bed. You wait three more days, taking the antibiotics which were supposed to fix you, until you're scared enough to head to the Emergency Room. Because you can't breathe.
The nurses put some tubing under your nose and now you don't have to breathe so hard. You're seen by yet another new doctor in the afternoon. He's wearing a lot of stuff your other doctors never wore. It's hard to hear him as he speaks through two masks. He probably says something about that virus that’s going around. The COVID virus. And you're shocked because you thought it was the flu, and you haven't been around any sick people. You don't know where you got it from.
Four hours later a different doctor comes by (also wearing a lot of masks and a yellow dress) and says you're heading upstairs. He asks you even more questions. By this time, you had to switch to a face mask to get enough oxygen to breathe ok.
You spend the night in the hospital. You're woken up at 11PM, 1AM, 2AM, and 5AM for a nurse to come take your vitals. If you take your mask off for even a minute, you feel like you've just run up 2 flights of stairs.
Your newest doctors (there's a few of them) wake you up around 8AM. They listen to your lungs, look at the monitor next to your bed that beeps sometimes, and frown. You can tell even under the masks. They say you're going to get different pills. One of them isn't usually used to treat the COVID, but you're desperate to breathe and you agree to it.
Your nurse keeps coming into your room to check your monitor a few times in an hour. You're breathing just as fast as you were at home, even with the mask of oxygen on.
Suddenly there's a lot of talk outside your room. Maybe you can make it out over the sound of the whooshing air into the mask and your own breathing, maybe not. Doesn't matter.
If you were listening, you'd hear an anesthesiologist asking why he was called stat to the room when a decision hasn't been made yet to intubate or not. (Intubate. Do you know what that word means?) You hear a different doctor ask why they weren't called earlier to first evaluate the patient before the anesthesiologist was called. After a minute or two you see a tall doctor (you’ve lost track of how many new doctors you’ve seen) enter your room, again with the masks, and the yellow dress.
Things start to move faster now.
He speaks quickly but seemingly without worry in his voice. ""How are you feeling?"" (Did he even pause to introduce himself? You can't remember.) You answer in clipped words. ""It's not hard to breathe,"" you say, ""but I just can't catch my breath.""
He explains that your oxygen is too low despite the mask. And he says the only way to help you keep breathing is to stick a plastic tube down your throat and hook you up to a machine. He explains you'll be asleep while it's in. You agree, because why the hell wouldn't you?
He exits just as quickly as he came in. Again, if you're listening closely, outside the door you hear him say to some people you can't see, ""We don’t need to intubate in the room, we've got a good five or ten minutes before he goes south. Get him to the pack you.""
You probably didn’t hear that last thing right.
You're rolled out of your room in your stretcher to an elevator. You go up and are wheeled into a busy room of lines with beds of other people with tubes down their throats, with only drapes to separate them. You’re pushed past dozens of people in yellow dresses and masks and plastic windshields on their face. There's more of those same dings and bells you heard from your own monitor, but they're all over the room echoing off the floors and walls and ceiling.
Another doctor says you're going to go to sleep. You look scared. You don’t ask any questions, you just keep breathing. The monitor behind you keeps dinging.
You don't even realize they pushed the medicine into your veins in the two seconds it takes for you to stop feeling or hearing anything.
…
Maybe you remember being in a fog as the medicine wore off a little. Maybe. You choke on the thing in your throat. Your eyes well up. Then you go back to sleep less than a minute later when you're given more medicine. You hope you don’t remember that.
Now you're wherever we go when we sleep.
You hope you wake up.",

Family told they have no choice due to Heartbeat bill,"https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/family-claims-atlanta-nurse-declared-brain-dead-kept-alive-pregnancy/85-eac5257d-a329-4dd7-b80f-5c0ecd30225a
The family of a 30-year-old metro Atlanta mother and nurse said she was declared brain dead more than 90 days ago — but is still being kept alive because she’s pregnant.
Adriana Smith, a registered nurse at Emory University Hospital, was nearly nine weeks pregnant in early February when she started experiencing intense headaches.
According to her mother, April Newkirk, Smith sought treatment at Northside Hospital but was released after being given medication. Smith was declared brain dead. Her family has been by her side every day since, including her young son, who they said still believes his mother is just sleeping. She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” Newkirk said. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there. And her son—I bring him to see her.”
Newkirk said doctors told the family the baby has fluid on the brain and they're not sure how much fluid. They're concerned about his health.“She’s pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” Newkirk said.
Under Georgia’s heartbeat law, abortion is banned once cardiac activity is detected — typically around six weeks into pregnancy.  The law includes limited exceptions for rape, incest, or if the mother’s life is in danger. But in Adriana’s case, the law created a legal gray area.
Because she is brain dead — no longer considered at risk herself — her medical team is legally required to maintain life support until the fetus reaches viability. The family said doctors told them they are not legally allowed to consider other options.
Not mentioned in this article but she was 9 weeks pregnant when she died. Insane to me that apparently the only legal option to turn her into a zombie incubator for 6-7 months.",

“The residents should run the Code Blues, they’re probably better trained than us.”
I’ll start off with what is good.
We’re becoming more adept at treating COVID cases. With a growing census of confirmed COVID positive patients (10 COVID positive in a census of 16 today), we’re getting a better sense of how this bastard virus behaves. There are the easy presentations: 40F w/ no significant PMH presenting w/ a 7 day hx of fever, dry cough, fatigue found to have bilateral ground glass infiltrates, elevated LFTs, lymphocytopenia and even fucking hypokalemia on admission. Might as well not even swab to confirm. (But the ED will, oh yes, because now they’re swabbing everyone and costing us probably 30-40 PPE kits per admission while we wait the 24 hours for the COVID test to result.)
But then there was the subtle one: 73M w/ multiple comorbidities who was diagnosed with simple CHF exacerbation and sepsis secondary to a UTI (positive UA and UCx) who was tubed on arrival to the ED, admitted straight to the ICU, found to be COVID negative 3/21. He is taken off the vent within 24 hours and discharged to the floors. Because he’s COVID negative you see. We treat him with antibiotics, work up his NSTEMI which he managed to throw in during his first day admitted and kind of take mild interest in his recurrent fevers. But he’s not coughing and is satting well.
Yesterday, my team and I thought “This guy has a normal white count, elevated LFTs and recurrent fevers. Forget the last test, order a repeat COVID.” I do this several hours before speaking with the attending physician. During table rounds, he pointedly asked me if I was aware of the protocols the Command Center had put in place for repeat testing. I say no, as these protocols change every day. (Side note: N95s are now rated for indefinite use, not just 4 days. Hope we didn’t toss all those other ones away for no reason!) “Cancel the test, let’s get Infectious Disease on board and ask them their input.”
I put in for the ID consult, I... ""forget"" to cancel the COVID repeat or inform the Command Center. Busy day as you saw from yesterday. Comes back positive.
We know what this bastard virus looks like.
But we spent 2-3 days in his room without our N95s on.
We would have spent more in there had we not tested.
We’re still early, but we know how fast or how slow a case progresses. Our younger patients, the 41F and the 49M might get discharged to home quarantine as early as tomorrow! They’re not reliant on supplemental oxygen and haven’t had fevers for >24 hours. Our older patients aren’t as lucky. No one on our census so far has been intubated. The 73M whose COVID we caught late rapidly progressed to requiring supplemental oxygen and was transferred to the SICU as the last stop before ventilator land.
We’re getting better as a team of residents. We’re all more than a little scared. I’ve talked to my favorite resident / current carpool buddy / best second-in-command about my anxiety about this situation. How the adrenaline kicks in when I’m on the floors and makes me feel less afraid and more focused. The crash after work is awful and the anxiety kicking back in takes a drink or two to knock down, but fuck it, I’m better at my work when I’m not terrified.
Oh and the food remains the best part of the day. Thank you, local places that sent great sandwiches for lunch and Greek for dinner. Makes the rest of this easier to write about.
Now on to what’s not good.
The hospital is now greater than 2/3rds COVID cases. The ratio of ventilators for COVID patients to non-COVID patients is 7:1.
We’re maxed out on the capacity of our Intensivists, intensivist PAs, and Anesthesiologists. The sprawl of the traditional ICU has taken over essentially anything that used to be elevated care and we’re still scrambling for beds. A handful of Internal and Family Med Hospitalists are being recruited to act as lieutenant Intensivists overseeing the ventilated. I mean lieutenant in its original definition: ""substitute,” “deputy,"" literally ""place holder."" They report to the Intensivists directly.
At lunch today, it was declared that due to the sheer number of Rapid Responses and Codes, and due to the overwhelming census of the Greater ICU, Residents responding to Rapid Responses are not expected to get any Intensivist backup.
I’m no stranger to Rapid Responses. You hear the call over the PA and are given a floor, you rush upstairs and enter a room blind with someone either choking, or unconscious, or bleeding, or seizing, or with a heart rate incompatible with life. You remain calm, you ask the patient questions while asking the nurses to give a summary of the patient’s medical background, current admission issues, latest changes, vitals, labs, imaging. Scary, but doable.
During the meeting, the Medical Director said the Hospitalists would be asked to run Code Blues. The Hospitalists balked.
See, Intensivists ran
every single Code Blue
in the hospital before now. One Hospitalist said, “We haven’t run a Code since residency! The residents should run the Code Blues, they’re probably better trained than us.” The room of a couple dozen full-blown-attending Hospitalists nodded in agreement. I was the only resident there, too stunned to speak up. No final decision was made.
I know the timing of Epi pushes and ACLS algorithms enough that a couple days’ review would cement it pretty well. But the actual pressure of making the call for a defibrillation or a push of atropine or adenosine is so beyond what I’m emotionally prepared for.
CPR is a violent, ugly thing with a fatality rate that is 100% for COVID patients with lungs too full of fluid for their heart pumping to matter. Even if I were to run everything perfectly, the person is still going to die. Let alone if I make the wrong call.
I’ve come to terms with the idea that I’m going to see COVID patients die under my care
a whole fucking lot.
I don’t want to be forced to watch them die under my care from three feet away while I make a series of life or death decisions that are guaranteed to be utterly pointless.
​
​
Day 5
“If you’re going to stroll around here, you’re going to need full PPE”
“Usually takes about 20 minutes, then everyone’s arms get tired”
If this hospital is at war, it’s ceding territory at an alarming rate.
Here’s the layout of the field: we’ve got medsurg wings on the cardinal points of the compass (except 2SW for some reason) in a somewhat random pattern from first floor to fifth: 1N, 2S, 2SW, 3N, 3E, 5E, 5S. The ICU, CCU, CICU, and SICU are floating around the periphery of the 3rd floor.
By the time I started Day 1, 2SW and 5E were already on lockdown and designated as COVID territory. My team alone had a total of two pending and one confirmed COVID cases.
By Day 2, the CICU became a conflict zone and joined 2S and 5E. 5 COVIDS or pendings.
By Day 3, my team had pending tests in 5S as well. 6 COVIDs or pendings.
By Day 4, the 5th and 2nd floors were entirely given over to COVID. 3E still had some non-COVID evacuees waiting to be transferred to the last bastions of 1N and 3N. Everything ending with -CU is overrun by this point.
It’s Day 5. My census stands at 15, of which 9 are COVID positive. There’s talk of clearing out 1N sooner or later even.
The hospital is fairing less well: of the 170 or so inpatients (not counting the 25 or so Greater ICU COVID positive people on vents), 100 are COVID positive, and a third more have pending tests.
…
So those are the numbers. Actually walking the halls puts the change from Day 1 to Day 5 in starker contrast.
The amount of PPE used per nurse or CNA has steadily increased. On any floor (except the Last Bastion wings), if you squint your eyes all you can see is uniform green paper scrubs with blue hairnets and and blue paper booties and blue paper masks +/- an N95 underneath. If you look further down the hall you’ll see a spray of yellow as one of them gowns up to enter a patient’s room. (The nurses have been using Sharpies to write their names on the paper gowns so people can tell each other apart.)
Maybe you’ll spot a Resident in a long white coat rush by.
And by every single door on wheeled tables usually topped with hospital food are boxes and boxes of blue gloves and yellow gowns. Might be my imagination, but the boxes of face masks are disconcertingly not as ubiquitous.
The Greater ICU is less colorful. Just window after window of people on vents. Walk the whole length of it and count maybe one person who’s conscious. Most don’t look like our usual ICU clientele of the cachectic elderly. These are mostly men (my imagination?) ranging from their 50-70s.
I made the mistake of asking who the youngest intubated COVID patient on the unit was.
Younger than me.
So we finish at the ED. It’s not chaotic like a Saturday night. Sure there are a few beds in the hallways, but that’s nothing new. I walked the length of it too. Some people on oxygen here and there, wider variety of ages.
Lots of people getting gowned up to enter rooms though. And I know we’re supposed to take them off at the door of the patient’s room, why are people walking around-
“HEY! If you’re going to stroll around here, you’re going to need full PPE. With an N95 on!”
The ED is now considered COVID home territory.
…
I don’t feel like a soldier. I don’t feel brave for showing up to my job. I most certainly don’t feel like a hero.
I feel like the tide came in way too fast and now I'm staring at waves from below.

Day 6
“There’s another Anesthesia Stat. Don’t know where we’re gonna put that one.”
55M with PMH of uncontrolled DM2, HTN, CKD3. Admitted 5 days ago for fever, SoB, dry cough, you get it. COVID positive on Day 1. Went to a COVID medsurg floor, experienced worsening hypoxia on NC, and started on nonrebreather. By Day 5, transferred to the newest territory grab of the Greater ICU, the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit - the PACU. We’re not doing surgeries anymore, so no anesthesia, so that’s free real estate to park the intubated.
One other thing. The PACU was never meant for anything longer than a few hours’ stay and has only drapes between beds. No doors or walls means this is COVID home turf. You have to completely PPE up to even enter the unit.
This newest long walk of ventilated COVID patients is kept alive by 2nd string equipment. No modern touch screens, no real time graphs, just an aged-beige box with some dials and digital-clock-red settings. It does the same job - you can set the PEEP, FiO2, RR, AC/PSV just as precisely as the modern machines.
Even the third tier stuff never intended to serve as ventilation for the 10-14 days of ventilation COVID patients may require works well. These are the surgical ventilators the anesthesiologists used to use back when we did surgeries. They have been liberated to serve the Greater ICU. We’ve even drafted the ad hoc ventilators of the local community of outpatient docs to act as reserves.
Code Blue called on the 55M gentleman above. The team rushes up and I am deeply relieved that it’s not a Code I have to run. By the time we get our PPE on (takes about 3 minutes), he’s already being intubated. No chest compressions required. We put in some orders, we watch the Veteran Attendings tube their first patient of the day. It is only about 8AM.
”Anesthesia Stat to the ED” heard on the overhead PA means someone is getting intubated essentially right after they enter the door. The Intensivist sighs and wonders out loud where they’re going to place this next patient on a vent.
The Greater ICU is quickly becoming The Empire of the ICU as more unused departments get swallowed up by the need to house the intubated.
...
I try to comfort myself with knowing I'm still living in the
good
days, relatively speaking.
No one on the hospital staff is sick. No one on my team or Residency program is sick. I'm not sick. We still have beds and ventilators, at least for the time being.
We've still got a week and a half for this to reach its peak.",

“A beautiful day in hell”
​
The 88F who signed the DNI/DNR was transferred from our service to a sister service also staffed with Residents a few days ago. The hand over occurred for no reason other than she was roomed in a wing that the COVID team recently took over wholesale. My team is no longer in charge of her case. But I’ve been chart-stalking her vitals and prognosis regardless because she’s still my patient.
And the prognosis is not good. Even on a 100% nonrebreather, her sats are in the mid 80s. Without the DNI, she would have been on a ventilator a day or two ago. She’s tachypneic, taking a breath every other second or so. Palliative care has been consulted and she’s been placed on ever increasing amounts of morphine to help curb her air hunger. As of this afternoon, she’s been placed on a morphine drip. She’s still wide awake, but her prognosis is dire.
That’s a word we get to use in charts.
Dire
. Seems almost melodramatic.
I decide to use some of the free time I have on this puddle-grey afternoon to leave my call room bunker and go visit her. I make a brief stop to get an update from her new team. It’s as bad as I thought. I ask if she’s going to make it through the night. Probably. Maybe not tomorrow night though.
I put on the PPE including my shiny new and properly fitted N95 I picked up that morning, and enter the room. I make a point to avoid reading the Fox News's chyron on the room's TV. We make small talk about her lemon ice cup. She likes it, I tell her I like them too and have stolen a fair number of them from the floor’s patient fridge over the years.
She knows something is up. She asks why I’m checking in on her, and I can see her get a little out of breath taking the mask off for even a few seconds then saying one sentence. I say I don’t like the direction her oxygenation is going, and I’m concerned.
“So I’m losing my battle?”
Really starting to hate that metaphor.
""This comes as a surprise.""
She met with our Palliative care team 2 days prior and comfort care was started.
She asks flat out what her prognosis is.
Once again, because I am an idiot, I tell her the truth.
I say that she might be seeing the end of her life sooner rather than later. Maybe less than 1 week at the rate things are going. I avoid using the word
dire
. When she asks if she's dying, I say unfortunately, yes.
""So you transfer me to another doctor and I'm dying. Your team must feel like failures.""
Not a word of that is misquoted or taken out of context.

Day 9
“You want to push another epi?” “Sure, why not.”
​
Overhead on the hospital PA:
“As you know, today is National Doctor’s Day. Let’s conclude this quiet moment by standing where you are and applauding our heroic physicians.”
As that played, half a dozen nurses and I were frantically getting into our PPEs outside a suspected COVID room to rush into a Code Blue.
Surprisingly, no one stopped to applaud.
Inside, the calming voice was drowned out by the hiss of a nonrebreather, the labored expiratory moans of the patient, and the warning dings of the bedside monitor. The bedside monitor was not happy that the patient’s heart rate was somewhere in the high 160s and was letting the room know its opinion on the matter.
Narrow complex ventricular tachycardia. But the patient isn’t hypotensive or otherwise unstable. You don’t lay on the paddles of a defibrillator for that.
“You’re going to feel a little funny for a second,” is what the nurse says to reassure the patient. What she really meant was, “We’re going to stop your heart for a second or two to reset your circuit breaker, so if it feels like you’re dying briefly, it’s because you are.” The nurse draws up some adenosine, the other MD in the room slams the bolus into the patient’s veins, and everybody gets to watch the monitor flatline for a held breath before a heart rate returns. Takes two boluses for it to take.
Problem solved.
For 73 minutes.
Nothing was playing overhead for the second Code Blue. Thankfully, an intensivist was already inside running the show. I guess the Residents haven’t been left out to fend for ourselves yet. This time around the bedside monitor was simply furious that the patient stopped breathing.
Pulseless electrical activity, PEA. The heart’s wires are firing but the pump isn’t working. You don’t lay on the paddles of a defibrillator for that either.
Hollywood has lied to you your whole life.
“Do you think we’re going to be able to resuscitate him?” “He’s full Code.” “But do you think
we’re going to be able
to resuscitate him?” “No, but…” “Right, so it doesn’t matter. We’re running the Code.”
I get my exercise for the day by pressing on the patient’s chest for a couple minutes.
“I don’t really want to intubate him.” The patient gets intubated anyway.
The respiratory therapist on my right (I think it's the RT, at least, everyone looks the same unders layers of PPE) gets a small spray of pink frothy fluid on her gown. Thank Christ for PPE.
A few people cycle through pushing on the patient’s chest. We haven’t felt a pulse since the Code began.
“How long has it been?” I suspect there’s a countdown timer in the intensivist’s brain that’s ticking towards an alarm labeled
Ok, We Tried
.
More compressions. Pretty sure I feel a rib break under my palms.
That
sensation never ceases to make me wince.
Another epi. Still no pulse.
The Doppler to check for a pulse is silent.
The timer goes off.
“That’s it.”
Time of death called.
…
Feels like COVID is eroding the edges off everyone’s soul in the hospital.
The initial novelty of sharp fear and apprehension standing outside COVID rooms before entering is giving way to a constant background dull dread as we gown up for the tenth or twentieth time that day.
I see my incredibly sharp attending boss distracted, needing to be reminded two or three times whose room he’s about to enter.
The lack of success in curing our patients is also taking its toll. “Successes” have mostly been defined as sending a patient home with personal oxygen tanks and explicit instructions on when to return if they get worse. We’ve had some milder cases that got sent home without oxygen, but they seem fewer than the number we send to get tubed.
I feel very bitter about this. It makes the sign out front, a sign that expresses nothing but pure gratitude and love, seem somehow mocking.

Day 10
""How many for you?"" ""Two."" ""Of twelve? Not so bad.""
​
88F w/PMH of HTN, prediabetes, Afib (on Coumadin) presented w/ a 3 day hx of progressive SoB, cough and subjective fevers. Found to be COVID-19 positive. Hospital course significant for clinical deterioration during stay requiring supplemental O2 via NRB. Repeat CXR 3/29/20 showed interval development of diffuse increased interstitial markings concerning for multifocal B/L PNA. Pt started on comfort measures but was found to be…
…
Let’s start over.
There once was a woman who lived a really long time. Let’s call her Ethel; she looks like an Ethel.
Like any octogenarian, Ethel had a few health issues, for which she took exactly seven pills each morning. It sounds like she lived a full life. We only really know that she was a NON-SMOKER and LIVES AT HOME. No one wrote down anything more than that in the box that’s supposed to summarize Ethel’s social life. She had a husband who was her emergency contact. There’s no box to check if they loved one another, but it’s probably a given that this theoretical box would house a neat little checkmark inside. She had at least one daughter, whose name probably could be found in a chart under ""Most Favorite Person in the World.""
Unlike other octogenarians, Ethel never visited the hospital. She saw doctors, sure (that was the price of growing old) but as far back as the computer can look, there’s no record of her ever setting foot inside the Emergency Room, up until ten days ago at least.
Ten days ago she came to the hospital because it was getting harder to breathe. She also had a fever and her muscles were always sore, but it was the huffing and puffing that scared her enough to head in. She got some oxygen and was given a room inside the hospital all to herself. She got that room because she had COVID – that virus which was causing the whole world to go crazy and her neighborhood to shut down. But the nurses were kind and the food wasn’t so bad. The oxygen helped her breathe. She was getting those drugs the President said would cure COVID. She probably liked the President. She sure liked to watch the News on TV.
On her third day in the hospital, a doctor came by and explained that since she needs a mask to breathe, if things got worse, the next step would have to be putting her to sleep and hooking her up to machines to keep her alive. Ethel didn’t want that. But her Most Favorite Person in the World would want her to FIGHT, so she reluctantly said she would be ok with a plastic tube down her throat. But the doctor said that this was Ethel’s choice, not her daughter’s, and it was an important one. He left the room so she could decide what to do.
The form she signed was bright pink. It had boxes on it that housed neat little checkmarks next to DO NOT REVIVE and DO NOT INTUBATE.
Ethel continued to take her medications and continued to breathe with a mask. Sometimes the very nice nurses would tell her to lie on her belly because it would help her breathe better. It was getting harder to breathe, even with the mask. Ethel thought the medications were making it harder to breathe, but believed once she completed the five days, she would start feeling better and could go home.
Those five days came and went. She wasn’t feeling better and could not go home. Another doctor came by and explained that her specialty was helping people feel better towards the end of their lives (which was only a possibility in her case, not something written in stone.) Ethel liked the morphine this other doctor gave her because it made it easier to breathe. Ethel did not like the anxiety pills this other doctor gave her because they made her drowsy.
One day the same doctor she saw right before signing the bright pink form came to visit her again. He said she was going to die. Ethel was very angry at this because she thought she was doing better. She said some things which in the bigger scheme of things aren’t that important. But really she just wanted the doctor to call her family to tell them what was going on.
Ethel got more and more morphine. She kept asking for it so often that the nice nurses put a machine in her room that gave her morphine around the clock.
Ethel couldn’t or maybe didn’t want to answer the doctor’s questions anymore.
Ethel was very tired during the day, so she mostly slept.
Ethel went to sleep one afternoon and didn’t wake up.

227 of 257 patients in the hospital are COVID positive. 41 COVIDS on ventilators. The ICU has expanded to the Cath lab. 1N and 3N have fallen, they're both COVID units now. I don't know how many ventilators we have left.
The passing of ""Ethel"" today marks the first patient formerly under my team’s care to be killed by COVID.

“…unless it’s ’visibly soiled.’ Like we could

Corona.”
​
I’ve been known to flirt with the LD50 of caffeine, but this morning I’m slipping it some tongue.
I’m status post two pieces of 100mg caffeine gum and a cup of coffee by 6:30AM. I hit 70 on the back roads heading towards the hospital in the minutes just after sunrise. There are practically no other cars around. My AirPods stream Andrew W.K.’s “Ready to Die.” A tasteless choice, sure, but it fits the energy of the day so far.
The 73M with multiple comorbidities who developed an NSTEMI, and who tested positive for COVID 4 days after testing negative has steadily been declining in the SICU. He’s refusing his medications despite his seasoned ICU nurse using the full spectrum of asking, demanding, and sternly admonishing him on his nonadherence. She even broke out the fake tears, she told me. She doesn’t do that for everyone. But no dice.
More importantly he’s doing poorly on a nonrebreather (NRB). If he takes the mask off, his sats drop to the 70s, a value you might guess correctly to be incompatible with life. He’s a little altered and he’s been put on dilaudid and a wrist restraint. Just the one, a CVA left the left arm safely useless.
One of the interns asks me what the plan was for our patient here.
“Palliative has a Goals of Care meeting with his family today. Our only plan is to keep him alive long enough for them to sign the DNI/DNR.”
I can blame the caffeine, I can justify it by saying his prognosis was
dire
and it’s reasonable to think we did all we could, but I scare myself a little with how low my empathy’s dimmer switch is set.
But I don’t know how else to deal with this. The recommended treatment guidelines changed, yet again. Azithromycin is now actively
counter
-indicted for COVID patients. We take him off it. Steroids, which as of yesterday were counter-indicated for COVID are now the standard of treatment for all patients on NRB. We start him on Solu-Medrol 1.5mg/kg divided BID. For all the good that will do.
He’s also well past the 5 days of Plaquenil / hydroxychloroquine. You know, that drug that was supposed to solve this whole crisis?
We all remember that right? I’ve got photographic proof we used to believe it would work.
Take a look at the March 17th (or Day -5, if you’d like)
National Enquirer
cover:
CORONAVIRUS
CURES

FOUND!
Warning! Surgical masks
SPREAD INFECTION!
Take a look at
every single intubated patient’s
medical orders and you’ll see they either completed or are on Plaquenil and azithromycin.
And people
still
think we have any handle on this other than jamming tubes down throats and waiting.
No one will believe the history of this thing when it’s over.
The patient passed that afternoon.
His daughters had signed a DNI/DNR right before.
…
I’m reminded of an intro Stephen King wrote for one of his books, where he writes about fear:
""The shape is there, and most of us come to realize what it is sooner or later: it is the shape of a body under a sheet. All our fears add up to one great fear, all our fears are part of that great fear - an arm, a leg, a finger, an ear. We're afraid of the body under the sheet. It's our body.…And [the writer] takes your hand and he enfolds it in his own and he takes you into the room and he puts your hands on the shape under the sheet… and he tells you to touch it here… here… and
here*…""*
A quarter million Americans (
at least
) are going to become bodies under sheets in the span of one or two months. And we’re talking about returning to work and a “miracle” ending to this in nine days.
Wake up and feel the corpses.
(PS: Yes, I owe Stephen King a royalty check given how much I crib his writing style.
)

​
Day 12
“I will continue using military metaphors. We are at war with this virus.”
​
The greetings this morning were grim.
“Stay safe” has become the
aloha
of intra-Resident conversations. I heard that twice before reaching the front doors of the hospital by 6:50AM.
“How was the night?” is the standard greeting to the two Residents just finishing their 12 hour Night Float shift. These are the two young MDs left to put out fires across half the hospital’s two hundred or so non-ICU beds.
“We had the longest Code ever. Took an hour. We went through maybe 20 epi’s.”
Epinephrine is only given to people with either pulseless electrical activity or those who are asystolic – flatliners. (Once again, Hollywood has lied to you. You don’t put the paddles on anyone with a monitor next to them going
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP
.) The ACLS guidelines say you push epi every 3-5 minutes.
The
Ok, We Tried
alarm should have gone off about 3-4 epi’s in. Not 20.
“Was it a young guy?” “No, It was John.”
I curse a little louder than I mean to. I walk out of the room and wash my hands even though I’m sure I hadn’t touched anything.
John is-
was
a nurse at my hospital. He
was
maybe in his early 50s. Every Resident loved him because he was tough and always fought for his patients. He was a nice guy and a pleasure to work with. But he was fierce. He’d seek us out during Rounds, stare us down and make sure we put in orders for his patients ASAP. We all respected him.
I knew he was on a vent as of the night before with settings that looked, well,
dire
, but it’s still a shock.
The night team leaves. I start mindlessly updating the cheat sheet summary of our 16 patients. I’m on autopilot at this point. 13 are COVID cases. COVID cases are, unfortunately, very easy to manage. You put in orders for medications that you’re pretty sure don’t work, you note how bad their oxygen saturation is on nasal cannula (NC) or nonrebreather (NRB), and you gown up and see the worst cases / people you think might need to be intubated in the near future.
The first Rapid Response comes at 7:40AM. I reach the door (of course it’s a COVID room, that’s all we have left) and realize I left my N95 at home. I’m not entering that room. I flippantly tell the interns to assess the situation and head to pick up a new mask at the Command Center.
The nice nursing admin lady hands me a paper bag with a new N95. She tells me to sign for it in the binder just outside the door. Despite my autopilot brain, I joke, “Oh we’re on the honor system? You know I’m just going to sign ‘John Smith’ in the binder right?” She laughs and says it’s ok I left my N95 at home.
I take my mask and sign John Smith in the binder.
Just because I’m in shock doesn’t mean I can pass up a joke like that.
I head back up to the Rapid. I get a debrief that this was narrow complex ventricular tachycardia in the 200s. They pushed metoprolol (wrong decision) and adenosine (right decision). I go talk to the very bright and hardworking intern on my team. I explain that in situations like this where the patient is otherwise hemodynamically stable, metoprolol isn’t going to do enough to slow the heart rate. You’ve got to reset the circuit breaker. I asked who the attending was in the room.
There was no attending. The intern had to make the call.
I left my interns to the wolves when I walked off in a huff to go get a new mask.
My autopilot brain goes over how shitty I am of a senior Resident.
When YOU were an intern, at least your seniors never walked away from a Rapid.
As I walk back to the call room to barricade myself behind a door for an hour or so, I come upon a nurses meeting where the news of John’s passing was being announced. I honestly don’t remember a single word of it. I do remember the occasional sobs coming from these amazing women.
Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID is intubated.
Table Rounds.
Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID is intubated.
I’m getting good at assessing whether or not a hypoxic COVID patient will get tubed and if we have time to get them upstairs before they crash.
Go me.
…
“The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places.”
I worry that some of my fellow Residents will break in the near-future.
It wouldn’t be a big break, just a small one that makes you sob on the way to work and dread every new day. For what it’s worth, so long as no one in the residency program gets sick, I don’t think I’ll break. A few of us are close though.
It‘s the Night Float’s birthday today. Which means she technically coded John for 60 minutes on her birthday in the pre-dawn hours. When she tells me this, we tell social distancing to go fuck itself and hug for a while. I offer to take her shift and work a 24, but she declines.
The possibility, the
comfort
of breaking feels like it’s hiding just over the horizon waiting for us.
It’s what follows that Hemmingway quote which worries me.
“But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.”
John never broke.
He was good, and gentle and brave. And he was killed.
​
​
Day 13
“Where do you want dad to die? Paralyzed on a ventilator or not?”
​
Quiet day. Got time to take stock of everything.
The hospital is housing somewhere around 250 patients including the regular floors and the Empire of the ICU, >90% positive COVID. My team’s census for tomorrow is 100% COVID. There’s talk about transferring the few remaining COVID-negatives to the USNS Comfort.
Oh, and yesterday some moron tried to crash a train into the USNC Mercy on the West coast. Because we’re dumb, panicky animals.
45 COVID cases on vents with a dozen or so vents available. A little over 60 people currently on nonrebreathers.
We're still 5 days from peak hospitalizations and 6 days from peak fatalities per day.
Personally, I think I’m holding up as well as I can. Writing has helped. Occasionally get some exercise in. Plan on going for a long walk tonight.
I’ve got 6 more days of scheduled inpatient care left. Two weeks of vacation after that. I’m thinking about signing up to do COVID swabbing since it pays well and I’d go nuts if I weren’t doing something.
I still hate the idea of treating this as a war, but I’m thinking about volunteering to be “redeployed” to another hospital elsewhere in the States once New York gets past this. The rest of the country is only a week or so behind. New fronts are opening up. I’m pretty well experienced in managing COVID cases at this point.
…
Feels like I’m living in the time between a flash of lightning and the roll of thunder.",

“Alright we’re done.”
​
I wonder when we’ll need a refrigerated corpse truck trailer.
Before my shift officially starts, at 6:50AM, a Code Blue is called. 90F w/ dementia and probably a long list of other comorbidities is found essentially cold and dead when the day shift nurse first walks in the room at the beginning of her shift.
Because mankind is cruel and irrational, this lady whose last real conscious thought occurred several years to a decade ago is still Full Code. So half a dozen nurses and four doctors all gown up and rush into her room to break her ribs before she's officially pronounced dead.
Because we're doing
everything to save her
, don't you see.
I swear to Christ I'm not this heartless when I'm the outpatient Family Med doctor I was supposed to be.
By the time I find a gown (a lovely, blue plastic trash bag of a gown which makes me sweat profusely and leaves my back slick with sweat and my gloves full of sweat and I pray we get those breathable yellow paper gowns again) then put on my eye protection and gloves and enter the room, the attending is already calling it quits.
The anesthesiologist asks if this patient (
this corpse
) needs intubation.
“If you want to intubate her that’s fine. If you want to put yourself through it.”
One push of epi.
There's no blood pressure, pulse was gone well before we got to work.
Time of death… who knows.
Does it matter?
…
I come back to my call room and look at the census. 22 patients, 100% COVID.
I scroll a third the way down the cheat sheet and see EXPIRED. At this point that just means alerting the attending of more paperwork to be done.
I round on all my patients. They're all miserable, can't catch their breath and have headaches. A very nice lady asks that if she and her husband are in the hospital, should her 90 year old mother who lives with them be afraid? The truth is if you flip a coin she's already infected. If she's symptomatic and needs to go to the hospital, she's got a good 1 in 5 chance of dying.
I neglect to tell her those odds. I tell my patient to call her mom, and that she should report any symptoms to her regular PCP.
Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID is intubated.
He was a younger guy, only in his 60s. He's got a chance.
Then table rounds.
Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID… isn't intubated.
88M w/ dementia plus many other things. He'd never make it off the tube.
We're here now. We're running low on beds and ventilators and the Tough Decisions are being made.
The
guidelines
the dictates of the Gods of the Empire of the ICU as of a few days ago were a patient could only be intubated if they were A) satting <90%, B) tachypneic >30RR, and C) prone when these were taken.
Now we're adding on if they've lived a life well into their 80s or if they've got dementia or if through ""clinical judgement"" you know they're hosed, then they won't be tubed.
It makes total sense.
I've had a few calls now where I've gone through the pre-written script for letting the typical patient's spouse of decades and decades know their world is about to end. How that soul they've nuzzled up against for comfort is close to depart since death is inevitable.
""Not a candidate for invasive intervention"" is the exact phrase.
Rationing? Cold calculation in an unprecedented time of suffering?
Truthfully, I'm thankful I’m not making these decisions.

​
Day 16
“Basically they wanted me to lie to the family. Say ‘we did everything we could.’ But we didn’t.”
​
This is when things start getting bad.
Did I feel it when I walked in today? The shift in the air?
One of our patients, a lady in her 80s, has been steadily degrading, gasping for air on a nonrebreather for close to two weeks. Palliative was brought on board yesterday.
Palliative calls the patient’s husband. It’s documented right there in the chart: “Pt has living will expressing no aggressive measures including CPR and Intubation however her husband appointed HCP does not want to place limits. Call placed to pt's husband for follow up. He is unwilling to talk further than ‘I want my wife home.’”
Overnight, the patient remained febrile, 102.7F despite Tylenol and cold packs. Hypotensive, 50/20s. Agonal breathing. It’s a sight you won’t forget after you’ve seen it. The clinical definition is disturbing enough:
“…characterized by gasping, labored breathing, accompanied by strange vocalizations and myoclonus.”
ICU evaluates her and says she’s not a candidate for pressers, intubation, or CPR. But still, no DNI/DNR order is placed.
The Night Float calls the patient’s husband. He remains adamant that he “wants everything done.” Night Float is essentially told by the Emissary of the ICU to not even enter the room should she Code, then call up the husband and reassure him we tried our best.
There’s a piece of me that empathizes with the patient’s husband. He’s been married to her for who knows how long. He was probably terrified, in denial, and isolated.
But a bigger piece of me thinks he’s a
fucking monster
for extending his wife’s suffering explicitly against her prior wishes.
At 09:19, we get a call that she has stopped breathing. Code Blue goes off.
The nurse at the door says something about how she knows it’s futile but she didn’t feel right not calling the Code. Because FULL CODE and DOING EVERYTHING TO SAVE THEM is sacred. Or it was. Or something. I don’t know anymore.
I tell everyone the plan. “Two people and two people only in the room.” I point at my interns. “Stay outside.”
I put on my gown and gloves. Did I put on the stylish lab glasses I wear around my collar as an apocalyptic-chic fashion statement? No, I remember now. I kept my regular glasses on instead. Because a good 30 seconds into breaking this woman’s ribs someone else entered the room and put a plastic shield over my face.
But before that I asked for a backboard under the patient. She was wide eyed and dead but I still asked for it.
And before that I pointed at the clock and said, “In five minutes, at 9:26, we’re stopping the Code.”
I’m pretty sure I felt ribs pop in succession like a zipper when I started compressions.
I think it was only two or three minutes into the Code before the intensivist walked into the room. He asked the patient’s age (82) and if she had dementia (she did) and after learning so told us to stop immediately.
Time of death… who knows.
Does it matter?
…
I leave the room without making eye contact with anyone. I try to remain cognizant of my hands and the right way to take off my PPE without buying a metaphorical scratcher ticket for the slight chance of intubation or death.
My poker face must suck because I’m asked three times in a walk of 300 feet if I’m ok. (Not even poker face. It’s all covered with a mask. My eyes are giving me away.) A nurse, the Chief Medical Officer of the entire hospital, and the Medical Director of the entire hospital. They all ask if I’m ok. I’m not, but I lie.
I tell the truth to my patients and I lie to my colleagues and bosses.
The nurse who called the Code in the first place asks me if I’m ok as I’m walking out of (fleeing from) the unit. “Thank you, doctor. Thank you.” I can’t summon any words to respond.
Thank me for what?
is the only thought I have.
The Chief Medical Officer stops me and asks me if I’m ok tells me we’re going to have a meeting sometime today to discuss end of life issues.
The Medical Director asks me if I’m ok and sees right through me. He does his best to boost my morale.
He knows I’m a big fan of the food being offered to the Heroes of the Hospital (
I assure you I bitterly laughed while writing that
) and insists I go get some food. I half-heartedly say I had a piece of a donated heart-shaped Danish earlier, but he goes out of his way to physically walk me over to the Command Center where some breakfast burritos were delivered.
I appreciate this gesture so much. I’m just a little ashamed he had to spend time on me when he’s dealing with quite literal life and death decisions on an hourly basis.
I soft coded a patient and got a breakfast burrito for the trouble.
Go me.
I soft coded a patient.
I was protecting my team and the nurses and it didn’t matter if we put on pacer pads not or if we even tried epi and she was dead when I walked in the room.
Just please forgive me.",

I was facing a 5000 legal deposit, 'just to start' and facing months of stress dealing with the situation.   All the govt agencies I tried referred me to someone else. Instead I decided to walk away.

The AAP's official position has simply been ""tell your patients to shop around and don't consider any alternatives,"" which is literally useless. The current nutritional guidelines are heavily influenced by formula manufacturers and the milk lobby and I wish the AAP would seize this opportunity to break their grip.
Like many of the medical professionals on this forum I am seeing desperate parents (both at work and socially) who are struggling to feed their infants, and I wanted to take a minute to put my advice in writing. Maybe you guys will find it useful too. So here is the advice I am giving my patients, as a board certified pediatrician and as a father of two.
This advice applies to healthy infants, and will not be appropriate for significantly premature babies (born less than 36 weeks gestation) or infants with heart, kidney, liver, intestinal, digestive, or allergic diseases. If you are going to deviate from the AAP’s recommendations, have a chat with your pediatrician too and make sure that they agree with me, and that this plan is suitable for
your
baby.
Under 4 months
, infants need breastmilk or
infant
formula. There really is no safe substitute, and formula distribution should prioritize these babies.  If you cannot get your usual formula, consider some options:
A different infant formula. The difference between brands, or cow’s milk-based vs soy-based vs other plant-based infant formula are negligible and you can use any of them with confidence.
Hydrolyzed and amino acid formulas, while expensive and designed for babies with certain digestive issues, are nutritionally complete and are safe to give to healthy infants. They smell awful but babies don’t care.
Infant formula for premature babies is a little more calorie dense and contains a little more protein than stanard infant formula, but will do in a pinch.
European, Canadian, or UK infant formulas are great. Be sure to read the mixing instructions, as they often have a different scoop-to-water ratio than US formulas. If you are importing these, be sure that it is from a source you trust.
Breastfeeding mothers might want to
try increasing their supply.
This is easier said than done. Remember that US law requires your employer
give you time to express milk and a private space that is not a bathroom each time you need to pump
. This is one of the few areas of maternal-infant health in which US law doesn’t completely suck.
The following are
NOT
safe alternatives
Home made formula. Will likely have the wrong balance of macronutrients but will certainly lack important micronutrients. Often has a dangerously different osmolality. Infants eat whatever they are given and have dumb kidneys, so are prone to hyponatremia or hypernatremia and every pediatrician has seen a baby die this way. Don’t do it.
Diluting infant formula in insanely dangerous. Do not do this under any circumstances.
Toddler formulas (marketed for infants >12 months old), have more calories per ounce than infant formula and consequently a “meal” with toddler formula will contain less free water. In an infant this will cause constipation and hypernatremia/dehydration. I suppose if you had literally nothing else to give, but this is not a long-term solution, or even a week-long solution.
Between 4 and 6 months
, infants will still need some infant formula, but you have some options.
Solid food. You
should be starting solid foods at 4 months
, (
the AAP says 6 months
, but they are wrong). It is unlikely that solid food will make up a meaningful proportion of your baby’s diet until closer to 6 months, but you can start practicing with some rice or oatmeal cereal at 4 months. This is also a great opportunity to introduce allergens like peanut, egg, shellfish, tree nuts, and so on - the earlier they are introduced the less likely you are to develop an allergy. There are various products
like SpoonfulOne
that contain small amounts of the 16 most common allergens which you can mix into your 4 month old’s cereal.
Toddler formulas may be more calorically dense (and, consequently, have less free water) and still aren't ideal but it terrifies me less at this age. Not safe for long-term use but could get you through a weekend.
Between 6 and 9 months
you can really ramp up food+water (and consequently decrease your reliance on formula). The infant now has distinct hunger and thirst mechanisms so it will appropriately choose between food and water when hungry or thirsty. This means you could offer one bottle of toddler formula and a small amount of plain water and trust the baby to balance its calories vs fluid. But it also means that you can feed the baby a meaningful amount of food. By 9 months old I like my patients to be getting the large majority of their nutrition from food.
It is worth being familiar with
the macronutritional requirements of infants,
because they are pretty different than a typical American adult's diet. Total calories vary by sex/weight, but is typically around 600-800 calories/day. I encourage parents to be flexible with this, and you will see a normal infant's appetite vary hugely day to day or week to week. As long as you are offering good foods, just feed to satiation and don't sweat the details.
That said, here are the details. Daily intake (food+formula) at this age should include:
90-100 grams per day of carbohydrates
10-15 grams per day of protein
30 grams per day of fat taking special care to including a source of essential fatty acids including Linoleic acid and Arachidonic acid (5g/day) and α-Linolenic acid and Docosahexaenoic acid (0.5 g/day). You will find these in eggs, fish, olive oil, and cheese
There are a lot of micronutrient requirements but the simplest way to meet them is to use
a fortified grain cereal as your base
and mix in various pureed things. If you don't want to use a fortified cereal for some reason, take care to ensure that your baby is getting 1 mg/kg/day of iron and 400 IU/day of vitamin D. You will probably need supplements to achieve this.
Don't hold back on the variety of food. Vegetables, meat, fruit, seafood, nuts, everything. If the food is safe for you, it is safe for the baby (except honey - no honey until 12 months). Explore strong flavors and a variety of textures. Be mindful of choking hazards (peanuts, small grapes, etc). Finger foods are fun and great for motor skills, but your infant will not consume many calories on finger foods alone.
After 9 months
just feed food. If you are struggling to meet the fat requirements above, you can give some cow's milk. Infant formula is convenient but absolutely unnecessary at this age.
After 12 months
, baring a failure to thrive situation or a family that is hopeless at providing nutritious food, I actively discourage liquid calories. Children should eat food.
Common mistakes
to be aware of at all ages:
Goat's milk contains very little folate and its use as a primary calorie source causes megaloblastic anemia.
Cow's milk over 32 ounces per day impairs iron absorption and causes iron deficiency anemia
even if the diet contains otherwise adequate iron
. In children this is a hypercoagulable state and can cause cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. I have see this.
Plant ""milk"" (almond, oat, etc) is never appropriate for babies. Even the best of them have 50% the calories of human or cow milk, and 20% of the protein and fat.  Do not use. Plant-based infant formulas have added protein/fat and
are
safe.",
Medicine,https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/k9ep2a/anonymous_writings_of_a_covid_nurse/,2345,149,Anonymous writings of a covid nurse,"“You a nurse?”
I glance up from my phone and look at the young man before me, dressed in a rumpled blue Kroger apron and khakis. He’s maybe seventeen, possibly a little older. It’s hard to tell these days with everybody wearing a mask. We’re left to judge those around us based on their eyes and build alone. The enthusiastic, carefree manner with which he’d been jabbering at the bagger next to him before he turned his attention to me gives him away far more than what I could glean from his appearance.
“I am,” I answer. I’m coming straight from work, still dressed in my navy blue jumpsuit and the classic black departmentally-approved jacket that has my name and hospital logo emblazoned on the chest. I’m hungry, exhausted, and sore. I just spent thirteen hours getting my ass kicked in full PPE. There’s
at least
a stage two pressure ulcer behind my ears that stings perpetually, serving as a constant reminder of the year we’re living through. On a normal day, I’d probably enjoy this little social back and forth. On a normal day, I’d love meaningless pleasantries like chit-chatting about my job. But right now, I’m just looking to score some stale fried chicken from the freshly closed hotline before I sink wordlessly into a scalding bath with a glass of wine.
His eyes light up. I can almost sense it coming.
“What’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen?”
I might feel offended if there was anything left in me capable of feeling. It’s a rude enough question to ask in its own right, but it’s especially awful timing during 2020. My colleagues and I are in the middle of a war. Or maybe it’s a genocide. Somedays it feels like the unending tide of patients will never stop, mounting higher and higher until the collective crush of humanity finally stresses us to our breaking points. Mothers, fathers, grandparents, uncles, daughters. They fill our beds up regardless of whoever they are to whoever brought them in. And yet the rest of the world keeps on spinning merrily along, intentionally oblivious. Throwing birthday parties, traveling to the beach, celebrating 12th anniversaries over steaks and bloomin’ onions at Outback.
What actually
is
the worst thing I’ve ever seen, I wonder? Despite the numerous times I’ve fielded this query, I’ve never truly stopped to think about it before. A number of situations spring to mind immediately, but they’re all oddly blurry through the lens of distant recollection. I can’t picture faces. I can’t remember names. Truth is, this young kid in front of me might have been on my assignment yesterday for all that I know. Once the time clock gives its telltale chirp that my badge swipe has been registered, I dump everything in my locker and leave…including memories. It’s just the nature of the gig. Very few individuals ever sneak their way into my synaptic clefts and set up permanent residence.
But today? Today is different.
This is one of the shifts that’s made a rare impression on me, like pushing your thumb into a memory foam mattress. I’m left with a little divot in my psyche. Even now, standing before the plexiglass barrier in this dumpy Kroger with the lackluster produce section, I can mentally feel that little hollow and know that somebody has moved in. No vacancies today, I’m afraid.
I had a full line of folks today, but only one of them was riding my nerves. Old guy. Not that it matters in my opinion. Nobody deserves to die like that regardless of age. Covid, of course. What else is there to treat these days?
He’d picked it up from his daughter, I guess. Contact tracing is mostly an exercise in futility at this stage. It doesn’t matter, anyway. The moment I laid eyes on him at shift change I knew that he was a dead man. It was written all over him in a language that every single healthcare worker is fluent in. The head-bob with every inspiration. The way his collarbones and ribs became prominent as he gulped for breath like a man drowning in nothing. The faint sound of crackles, like cellophane being crushed between your fingers. The restless picking at his covers, his gown, his oxygen mask, clawing them all off with whatever strength he could muster. For whatever reason, most people prefer to exit the world they way they entered it; clothed in nothing, helpless to the elements.
I replaced his oxygen mask and ignored the blaring saturation alarm desperately attempting to alert me to the fact that he was in danger. He was already on 100% oxygen. He’d long since finished his round of remdesivir and convalescent plasma, for all the good they’re worth. Short of forcing pure O2 into his lungs with a pressurized noninvasive ventilation system, there was nothing else to be done. He’d never tolerate a BiPap anyway. He’d have it yanked off in a New York minute and I’d be left scrambling in the hallway to get geared up and put it back on before he coded. If his family wanted him to be full care, I was going to have to tie his arms to his bed. Even then, it was blatantly apparent that he wasn’t going to survive. He would die alone, fighting in restraints, suffocating slowly until his light was snuffed out by a strand of RNA a mere 70 nanometers in diameter.
I paged his attending and told him that it was time for The Talk. You know the one. The one where we admit defeat. Throw in the towel. The one where we switch gears from healing somebody to ensuring that they’re dying well. “Okay,” he replied with a sigh. “I’ll give them a call. Watch for orders and you’ll know which way it went.”
It didn’t go the way I expected, but it did go the way I hoped. I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw orders for morphine, ativan, and discontinuation of telemetry monitoring instead of serial ABGs, BiPap settings, and a stat chest xray. His futile fight was over. He would be allowed to exit stage left with a set of unbroken ribs, no tube expertly placed by a far-too practiced hand into his throat and threaded down until it reached his ruined lungs.
He finally went unresponsive and entered the actively dying phase about halfway through my shift, but I had the tools at my disposal to keep him comfortable. I pointed a fan straight at his face and turned it on high in the hopes that his brain would mistake the wind for breath. When he became air hungry, I had medications in my arsenal to keep him satiated. When he became anxious like a cornered animal, I had the tools to keep him calm. I turned the lights low. I brought in an LED candle and placed it on his bedside table. I pulled a chair next to him, held his hand, called his family and asked them what kind of music he liked to listen to. Old country, came the answer. Even though it was an exposure risk for me, I pulled out my phone and put my Spotify Premium account to good use. He won’t die alone, I promised them. I’ll be here. They thanked me for my kindness, my care, my compassion. They feel better knowing he’s in my hands, they say.
If only they knew that what
I
feel is nothing.
That's not a normal human reaction. It’s monstrous.
I’m
monstrous.
Who watches somebody die horrifically, far away from the people who love them, residing under every single isolation precaution we’ve ever developed a protocol for and has no emotional reaction at all? Who numbly performs empathetic actions solely out of the formulaic knowledge that it's the socially correct thing to do? What kind of nurse operates like this, anyway? We’re supposed to be the shining pillar of solicitude. We wrote the book on warmth and care. But, whatever a good nurse is supposed to be, I’m the antithesis of it now.
I'm an android masquerading as a normal person. I'm the Borg. A Geth unit. I feel like a computer crunching numbers on a spreadsheet, only the numbers are other creatures and I'm pretending to feel alive like them. Most days I’m thankful for the masks more for the physical distance it places between me and other people than the physical protection from illness. At least they can’t tell that what I’m demonstrating isn’t noble stoicism, but numbness.
Maybe this is self defensive. Maybe it's a trauma response. Maybe it'll all come back to me in a flood one day when this is all over and it'll bring me to my knees. Or maybe I'm just fundamentally broken as a person by everything I’ve witnessed this year. Maybe this is permanent.
I do recall that I used to feel. I used to cry with my patients when they received bad news, or genuinely cheer with them when they received good results. I used to celebrate every discharge as a small victorious moment in their lives and my career. I wasn’t always like this. I regret that I’m like this now, and yet I don’t know if I would change it even if I had the ability to do so.
I watched a man die today and felt nothing. And
that
, I think, is the worst thing I’ve ever seen.
But this kid doesn’t actually want to hear that. He doesn’t want to know the real stuff. He wants to be regaled with a glory tale. A story about how I once coded somebody and they farted with every chest compression. A quippy anecdote about some guy that “fell” on a cucumber that somehow mysteriously ended up in his rectal vault. It’s socially inappropriate to be honest and I don’t really care to be honest anyway. So I pause for a second before deciding what to say.
“Eloesser flap care,” I reply. “Had to pack a guy’s chest cavity twice a day with 26 yards of gauze. Every time I pulled the packing out it was like that old magic trick with scarves.”
He grimaces and laughs as his mask slips below his nose. He doesn’t bother to replace it. I don’t bother to remind him, because it changes nothing anyway. He has no perspective on what it’s like inside the halls of my hospital. He’s young and careless, even though he’s taken seventeen thousand selfies of himself in a mask to prove how conscious he is to Instagram. It’s just his nose anyway. Even if he gets it he’ll be fine, he thinks. And most likely, he’s correct.
It’s the nurse in front of him that isn’t fine.
I grab my bag of lukewarm chicken and leave. Clock’s ticking, afterall. I’ve got an alarm set on my phone for five AM so I can get up before the crack of dawn and do it all again.",

They cry. And they tell me they didn't know. They thought it was a  hoax. They thought it was political. They thought because they had a  certain blood type or a certain skin color they wouldn't get as sick.  They thought it was 'just the flu'.
But they were wrong. And they wish  they could go back. But they can't. So they thank me and they go get the  vaccine. And I go back to my office, write their death note, and say a  small prayer that this loss will save more lives.""

Most people that died of cancer likely had other underlying health conditions like COPD, heart disease, diabetes etc.
And since most of the people who died of cancer were very old, then they were already gonna die sooner or later, so it's not that much of a tragedy
Very few death certificates had cancer as the only thing written on it so obviously the death toll for cancer is massively exaggerated.
Speaking about death certificates, I know someone who had cancer but died after a car crash, and they listed cancer as a cause of death.
And how dare the government impose on my freedoms by banning smoking in public places or taxing sugary foods.
And all the measures that the government put in to prevent cancer like regulations for sugar, tobacco and screening programs are a massive dent in the economy.
Also have you seen how harmful the drugs that doctors give for cancer are? They are so expensive as well so I bet they're just given to line the pockets of big-pharma, I'll stick to my homemade orange juice.
And finally places like Africa put relatively little money into cancer research yet much less people die of cancer, so obviously all the measures we're doing are not working.

Details the case of an NP in Texas who was promoting himself as an endocrinologist, and killed two patients, injuring many others.
The outline:
KM was the graduate of an online NP school. Soon after graduation, he opened his own hormone clinic. Texas is a supervised state, his supervisor was a surgeon 140 miles away, who had no knowledge of what he was doing.
Amy Townsend, MD is a local physician who became aware of what he was doing because a friend went to KM for a refill of his synthroid. KM ordered 63 lab tests before even seeing the patient. His testosterone was normal, but he was given IM testosterone anyway. Dr. Townsend was aware of another patient of this clinic who had died at age 45 of an MI after large doses of testosterone. And then another death came to light. She made a formal complaint to the Board of Nursing. During this process, she found he had 13 other complaints lodged against him pending. The BON did nothing for many months, KM continued his practice unchanged. Dr. Townsend finally demanded to meet the BON in person, and drove 5 hours to do so. In the meeting they said they didn't have anyone with enough expertise to judge him. Dr. Townsend herself found an endocrinologist to review his practices, the BON did not extend themselves to do this. Over a year later, his license was removed.
What to learn from this:
1) there are NPs practicing with little training who will hurt people (The
EliteNursePractitioner.com
will even help NPs set up such practices. THey have a video course on endocrinology that the NP can buy, and they offer advice on the business aspects. THey will help the NP find a supervisor who wont' bother them.
2) Ethical NPs, RNs and Physicians are the only protection for patients, We can recognize this and take steps. Patients and other laypeople cannot.
3) Doing the right thing, as Dr. Townsend did, can be hard. And exhausting. But, we know what the right thing to do is. I would be pretty sure Dr. Townsend saved some lives.",

Turns out that the drug was simply 70 mg/ml instead of 50 mg/ml which almost every single other pediatric drug we use is and I hadn't noticed, and the pharmacist was right.
If I have a pharmacist correct an order I make, I'll hire a mathematician to verify before I think of calling back.",

Hey all. Wasn't sure where to post this, but
/r/medicine
seemed the most appropriate.
I'm a new anesthesiologist at a community hospital. We have not been crushed by COVID yet, but we're moving in that direction, and every day we're teetering on the precipice of at or beyond capacity. The policy in our shop is to have anesthesia do all COVID intubations if at all possible and there haven't been a ton of them to do so far, but we had a somewhat unexpected bolus today and I had a handful. Now, I'm usually pretty unflappable and can take a lot of stuff--I think a lot of us are, or were, before COVID--but one of the patients today really hit me hard.
He's an 80 year old with multiple comorbidities who's been steadily declining on increasing non-invasive ventilatory support. The ICU called us somewhat non-emergently understanding that the patient was definitely heading that direction. I go over there with a CRNA for extra hands, we PPE up, and start the preparations. The ICU doc is in there with us and does the procedural time out while we're setting up, but before we can get started the patient gestures around his hissing BiPAP for something to write with. He tries to say what he wants to say a couple of times, but the BiPAP is too loud and he just can't muster enough air to speak up over it. There's a bit of a scramble for pen and paper, and he just starts writing what we think are random words. One of the nurses pipes up and says, ""I think those are song names"", and the patient nods. Then he writes ""funeral"".
He was desperately scribbling the songs he wanted played at his funeral. He knew that he is likely to get worse, and that he may die--he explicitly told the ICU to keep him on the vent no more than a week, and told his family to hold them to it. He knew that this could be the last time his eyes close.
Then we intubated him and lined him up and went on to do the next one.
I don't think there is a way we go ""back to normal"" after all of this. There will simply be before COVID and after COVID.",

35M w/PMH of depression presents w/ a 19 day hx of going through hell. Found to be broken by COVID-19. Hospital course significant for bearing witness to many, many pts intubated and/or expired. Believes he brought comfort / humanity to some of his pts (results pending). Repeat rereading of his own story scared him. He started himself on comfort measures at home but was found to be…
...
Let's start over.
There once was a guy who lived for a fair amount of time but was still relatively pretty new at it, all things considered. Let's call him Danny; he looks like a Danny.
Like any guy with a couple letters after his name, Danny had a few issues with healthcare, which he fought each morning. And afternoon. And evening. And when he came home. It sounds like he lived a full(ish) life. We only really know that he is a DOCTOR and LIVES AT HOME. At least when he's not spending the majority of his waking hours in a hospital. He wrote a few things in the box that's supposed to summarize Danny's social life. He really should have written more in it though, since his friends and family have kept him somewhat happy while he's going through hell. He had a wife who is his emergency contact but who left him two days short of three months ago. There’s no box to check if they loved one another, but it’s probably a given that this theoretical box used to house a neat little checkmark inside. It used to at least. He didn't have any kids despite really wanting them, which hurt her and was one of the reasons the neat little checkmark went away. It really hurts when he looks at his chart under ""Most Favorite Person in the World.""
Unlike other physicians, Danny never got used to people being sick, despite his whole working-at-a-hospital thing. He saw sick people sometimes, sure (that was the price of being a doctor) but as far back as 21 days ago he never saw anything like this.
Twenty-one days ago he came to the hospital because he was scheduled to be the senior resident. He wasn't really sure he could do a good job at it, and the whole COVID plague really scared him. He got a whole room to himself to write his worries out and the history of each day. He barricaded himself in that room for hours and hours (when he wasn't responding to Rapids or Code Blues or talking to sick patients) because COVID took over his hospital. He prescribed the drugs he was told to by his bosses and listened to the President proclaim everything would be ok. He sure loathed seeing that orange fucking prick on TV.
On his third day in the hospital, he tried to do the right thing and limit suffering and protect the people around him. He offered his patient CHOICE and told the truth, even if afterwards it made him think he was a terrible person.
Danny continued to prescribe medications and continued to try to be a good person. Sometimes he'd joke around with the very nice nurses and it helped him breathe better. Danny wasn't sure the medications were doing any good, but he was doing what smarter people well above him recommended. And he wasn't God, you know, despite his Messiah Complex.
One day Danny came home after three weeks of working 7AM-7PM Sunday through Friday. But he took off the last day he was scheduled to be in the clinic because he couldn't take it anymore. He needed a break. And that was ok. Because he did break.
Luckily he had two weeks of scheduled vacation time starting the day after. And he wasn't going to volunteer to head back into hell.
Danny didn't do much of anything in particular. He watched
Some Good News with John Krasinski
which made him smile, he played
Stellaris
while listening to
Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend
which made him guffaw.
Danny finished off the last pieces of donated food to the Heroes of the Hospital he had smuggled home.
He still didn’t think he was a hero, but that's ok too.
Danny hung out with his friends and gave spontaneous piggyback rides and laughed a lot even if he sorta fell straight on his face and got a small laceration to his left eyebrow. Which made him laugh harder. It was his Least Favorite Eyebrow, anyway, so who cares?
Does it matter?
Danny didn't have to answer anyone's questions and stopped chart stalking the people he was taking care of. Because he finally realized he did his time.
And maybe did some good during that time.
Danny wrote some more one afternoon and it made him happy.
…
…
Maybe there's a book I could finish about this disaster so it could make some sort of sense now that it's passed.
For me at least.

Medicine,https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1jluhlj/had_my_first_baby_after_the_mother_attempted_an/,2180,187,Had my first baby after the mother attempted an abortion at home due to my state’s abortion ban,"I have been a NICU Respiratory Therapist for almost 10 years. In the largest NICU in my state. I have seen a lot of sad cases and infant death but I’m struggling quite a bit with this one. More than I have in a long time. My state like many others recently made abortion illegal with few exceptions. So I knew this day was going to come but nothing prepared me for just how bad this was. The baby had a severe case of a horrible extremely painful and gruesome fetal anomaly which I won’t say what it was. The anomaly isn’t always fatal so it doesn’t fall under one of the exceptions in the state for fatal anomalies. But with how horrible of an anomaly this was the mother tried to do the abortion at home. I don’t know much about the mother’s situation and I wouldn’t share anything if I did. But my state is at the very bottom in the country for access to prenatal care. So I would guess that she wasn’t made aware of the disease until late in the pregnancy. So when she attempted the abortion and had excessive blood loss and came to the maternity ED, the baby was far enough along we are required to resuscitate.
Even though the baby was not wanted, I still had to resuscitate. I had to get an airway and secure it and again in my 10 years experience, this was the most grisly thing I have ever done. And for what, the baby didn’t even live to 24 hours old. It was horrifying.
It’s been weeks now and I can’t get it out of my head. Due to the abortion ban, I knew something like this would happen but never like this. My heart is broken for that mom. My heart is broken for that baby and how much pain it must have been in. But the biggest feeling I have is anger for all those people that voted for it. I have been talking about and showing google pictures of the disease to everyone I know so they too can know the gravity of what this abortion ban means. Even though there are exceptions in the law, it doesn’t matter because either our access is so low that women are not able to get abortions even when they are suppose to be allowed to or they have a technically not 100% fatal disease and so are not except. This is so inhumane, I don’t know how I’m going to carry on doing what I do. Is this going to be my new normal? I have always had to deal with patients that I thought to myself they should have been aborted. But the parents made the decision to try anyway. But for this baby NO ONE I mean NO ONE in that deliver room wanted this baby. Everyone in the room from the mom, the dad, to the neonatologist did not want to have this baby born and have to resuscitate but some law maker and the people that voted for it that are not even in the fucking room or in the same universe of understanding are forcing us to. Im sitting here sick to my stomach about what happened and for the future of what this means and I don’t know if I can carry on with this.",

Medicine,https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/s4q626/stupidity_on_the_newborn_unit/,2174,483,Stupidity on the newborn unit.,"I just came out of a newborn exam with a new understanding of the level of obtuseness and stupidity that surrounds us.  Here are a few of the highlights.  Mom presents to maternity in labor (after getting marginal pre-natal care elsewhere, so we don't have records), and presents an extensive 'legal birth plan' outlining her desire for a natural 'lotus' birth.  The birth plan is mainly printouts of various conspiracy quasi-medical websites offering distinctly non-rational arguments against almost everything we do in newborn care.  She and partner are Covid vaccine refusers, and they refuse Covid testing on admission, so we are stuck with full PPE and have to put her in one of our scarce isolation rooms.   After delivery, she refuses to allow us to weigh the baby (eventually she changed her mind).  She refuses HepB vaccination.  She refuses erythromcyin ointment ophthalmic prophylaxis.  She refuses Vitamin K administration.  She didn't get eval for gestation diabetes while pregnant so we don't know if baby is at risk for hypoglycemia, but she refuses chemstrips.  I don my full PPE to examine the baby and have a discussion hoping I can educate them regarding risks and benefits to all these refusals.  I go through my spiel, trying to be calm and measured and factual, and they keep pushing the long 'legal birth plan' document at me, and I keep trying to refute the lies and inaccuracies and distortions that they believe, and make zero progress.  And all the while, since this was an intended 'lotus delivery' (and they intend to keep the decaying placenta attached to the baby until the cord separates), the baby is lying in its bassinet next to a dead placenta.  Fortunately the baby had a normal exam, but something tells me that keeping a dead organ attached after birth is a perfect setup for sepsis, omphalitis, and a prolonged stay in the NICU.  These people seem outwardly to reasonable and rational; they listen to what I present, ask some questions which I answer to the best of my ability, and then say they will consider what I've said, and then go ahead and sign the hospital required waiver acknowledging that they have been advised of the risks of forgoing standard practice care and basically continue to refuse virtually all aspects of care.  I've had to deal with anti-vaxxers in Peds for a long time, but this level of ""I've done my own research"" and I don't value your years of training and experience and refuse to take your advice -- is a new level of just wanton stupidity.  It's my job to try to help people understand complex medical issues and make informed decisions, and usually I'm good at that, but this just confuses the hell out of me, particularly when they are making these decisions not for themselves, but for their children, and placing those children at a level of unnecessary risk.  I'm ready to pop, I'm so depressed.",

Now Sarah has checked in....","She's in her 50's and fairly healthy. Four of her extended family members died of COVID complications. Her husband died a few months ago. Tuesday Sarah started feeling bad, and went to the urgent care. Her rapid COVID was negative, she was given the usual thoughtless Rocephin/Dex combo and discharged.
Now Sarah is in the ER. She doesn't look terrible, but she knows what's coming. We talk about her husband, her family, and how things have been going. She's had a hard time as of late, having lost most of her family support system. Her rapid test comes back positive. Her labs and CXR aren't terrible. She wants to be admitted, but we know its not going to happen.
I didn't have it in me to ask her why she never got vaccinated. And at this point its too late, so why bother. So I send her out, with best wishes and close follow up. And while I keep feeling anger and resentment living in a state with one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, right now I just feel pity for her.
And now that moment is over, and I am going to suit up to go talk to the next one, a 32 year old obese smoker with ""a cold"". She had to be asked twice by triage to put her mask on, and I can see through the window that she has already taken it off again and made herself at home in the exam room.",
