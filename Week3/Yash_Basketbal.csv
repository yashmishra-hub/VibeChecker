Basketball,https://old.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/1aq2r07/sorry_kid_you_are_not_going_to_make_it_to_the_nba/,1271,495,"Sorry, kid. You are not going to make it to the NBA.","So many posts here of young lads asking if they have a chance of making pro. The truth is, the odds, and the math, are not in your favor.
There are 30 teams in the NBA, each carrying a maximum of 15 roster players. That means there are a total of 450 players earning NBA salaries, with many of them never even seeing the floor in meaningful minutes.
While we do get the occasional feel-good story about the kid who only picked up a basketball for the first time when he was 16, but is now a starter for a playoff contender, those are
exceptional
cases. Like, 6'9"" freakishly athletic exceptions, born with 7' wingspans and springs for feet.
You likely aren't that guy, kid. Sorry to burst your bubble.
Which doesn't mean you should quit playing this beautiful game. Basketball is a game you could play recreationally well into middle-age. It's great for keeping fit, and for making lifelong friends. You might make your high school team, which is always a hit with the girls!
If you work really hard you might even get a chance to tryout for the collegiate team if you go to college or university. While pro life is probably a stretch, there are more than 650 Division 1 and 2 schools, all of which offer some sort of scholarship program. You likely won't earn a full ride, but even a partial scholarship can really help out a family while you get your degree.
All these words are to say: the math doesn't look good, if your goal is the NBA. Hard work is crucial, but genetics play a big part, unfortunately.
But that doesn't mean you can't train hard and get good at hooping. There are some great players in rec leagues around the world!",

This takes out a lot of fun when playing team pickup. A shot behind the arc shouldn’t count as double anything from inside the arc. I wish kids across the country would adopt this scoring system when playing pickup. And just go to 21 instead of 11.,

This week, after a conversation with my PT, it has been determined that I can no longer play. My ankle has no ligaments left from countless roles, and my calf muscle is degraded from helping that ankle. I am old, I can no longer play without pain, and risk doing more damage every time I’m out there. I believe basketball to be the greatest game in the world. Basketball has kept me sane in times of stress, and brought more consistent joy to my life than any hobby I’ve had. I don’t know why I’m posting this other than to say goodbye. I’m nothing special, just another broken down gym rat that can’t do it anymore. If you love hoop like I do, cherish every second you have out there. Time flies.

Basketball,https://old.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/1i5vjg2/wholesome_pickup_game_ill_never_forget/,914,29,Wholesome pickup game I'll never forget,"Im 37 ane 6'6"" plus and have had a number of lower body injuries. I used to play in HS and tons of pickup over the years, but my knees have given me issues and haven't played much at all the last 5+ years. I've been shooting around again lately for fun and enjoying it.
Last weekend at the local rec center a 13 year old was shooting on the other side of the court and his mom was helping with some drills. He had a good shot for his age and the Mom was putting him through the paces. A couple of high school kids around 16-17 years old came in and asked if we want to run 21 or 2s.
I suggested me and the kid take on the 2 high schoolers 2 on 2. Within minutes, one of the high schoolers was going at me hard and trash talking, fouling me etc. I tell him I'm not looking to go full speed, his answer ""you've got to always leave it all on the court"". Eye roll.
Okay so we're playing  make it take it 2s and 3s to 21. I get us a layup on a post move but we're down 2-6. I have basically decided I'm mostly going to feed my 13 year old teammate. I teach him how to run give and go, set him screens, drive and kick, kid hits some shots and I get another bucket and we tie it at 13 after I dime him up with a backdoor bounce pass.
I hit a jumper to make it 15-13, then drive and kick to my little buddy for back to back open 3s which he just drains and we win thr game 21-18. The high school kids can't believe it, little man's confidence is sky high.
He leaves with his mom and she thanks me, I tell him he played great and to keep working on his game. He tells me I am like Dirk Nowitzki which is about the coolest thing a 13 year old could say to me. We both left all smiles and I'm so glad I could help create that experience for the kid.",
Basketball,https://old.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/1i4qttr/with_all_respect_due_pickup_basketball_is_not_the/,895,257,"With all respect due, Pickup Basketball is not the NBA","Just gonna rant here for one of many bad pick up basketball experiences I've played
You people who take pick up runs seriously need to grow up and do something with yourself. And when I mean taking a run seriously, I'm talking about dudes who pick fights and argue over a pickup game. Especially all that clapping, screaming, and flexing, all that extra stuff over a LA fitness pick up game. Your a grown ass man yet somehow have no control over your emotions. Out throwing tantrums over what? Basketball? Brother what are you trying to prove
I'm out playing a game today, 5 on 5. Obviously in pick up the skill ceiling is wide spread so there's a guy on the other team going off against the more casual players & trying to show off too his friends on the sidelines? Telling them these guys can't guard him. I decide to switch onto him and I won't go into full detail but I can say I did a good job guarding him. Finally, few possessions later I get a block and this guy tells his friends ""This guy on my d--- bro."" We're checking up and he tells me, ""Yo you like men bro? Why you on my d---?"" I just reply, ""I'm just here to get my cardio bro"" He then replies shut up and I say nothing. Why? Cause I'm litteraly here just for basketball, why the hell would I fight over a pick up game, I aren't getting paid for this.
Later on, he gets an iso on the casual player again and gets passed them so I switch to go for the block. I jump vertically and he jumps into me and calls foul. So I go get the ball and suddenly the guy pushes my back???  This how the conversation went
Me: What the hell man
Him: Your doing too much
Me: I litteraly just went for a block bro
Him: F--- you dawg you wanna start something
Me: Start what? I'm litteraly here to play basketball
Him: I'll beat your ass
Me: Beat my ass over basketball? Your a grown ass man, the hell you getting mad over basketball for
Him: This grown ass man smoke your ass in ball
Me:  Ok great bro your a good player. Let's just have fun hooping. Aren't no one here getting drafted
Then the guy just try walking up to me to go face to face while being held back and throwing bunch of sturs at me?!? I just keep telling him, ""Good job bro, your willing to go to jail over basketball. Not only your a grown ass man who failed to get drafted but your a grown ass man willing to go to jail over basketballball""
Like this experience pissed me off and I'm not playing basketball for a while. Maybe if it was a one time occurance but people take pickup basketball to seriously man. I can't take the concept of a grown ass man getting angry over basketball seriously. Who you trying to show out for because I know damn well this isn't high school where your crush is in the stands. The only people on the sidelines watching is a bunch of other men wanting to play. Your telling me you want compliments from other guys? Your litteraly just putting a ball in the hoop. Your net worth didn't go up, if anything you lost money coming here just to pick fights over basketball. Maybe you people need to be reminded this a damn hobby and no one cares if you drop 50 points on bunch of dudes who finished a 9 to 5. Your telling me you've been alive for atleast over 20 years and still have the audacity to come out lashing out like a 4 year toddler.
Now
If you're getting angry cause you didn't get the ball and don't know how to be effective outside jacking up 20 shots on the court, sucks to be you. There's other ways to have fun playing the game than having the ball in your hands. If you lost a game badly, alright, just accept it, you were worse. I've lost games 21-4 while the guy was talking trash to me the whole time, but you know what? I said nothing and just hooped because it comes down to 2 things. It's either what he's saying is right or you prove it by your game. Flapping your lips back isn't gonna change the outcome. If you're gonna tell me self-respect, self-respect is finishing the game, moving on, and knowing what people not to deal with the next time. The self-respect many of you people are thinking about is the one in the industry. If you don't actually show yourself self-respect, you can actually be losing money. The only time I guess you can be yapping back is if your still a high schooler trying to make the NBA cause you have a dream and people's trashing at it. But at LA fitness? Guess what, we are all regular Joe's bro.
And unless you're getting paid to play, shut up and play. If you don't like people disturbing the game over dumb arguments, why are you out here doing the same. If you wanna pick fights, just pick up boxing. And if your out here calling guys trash/trying to get in their heads just to try to prove your better, guess what your all leaving the court to rarely see each other again, go to bed, and go to work again while there's a actual young guy out there playing D1 with a real chance of making the NBA while you didn't. And if you aren't going to work and hoop every day, get a job, bro, putting a ball in the net, aren't all of that
Edit: I appreciate all your responses and stories you guys shared. Made me feel much better
Edit 2: Just wanted to make it clear, when I say taking pick up runs seriously, I mean to a personal level where you want to fight or hurt the person in anyway. There's nothing wrong with trying your best and to be competitive on the court because that's what everyone's there for. To play basketball",

Basketball,https://old.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/1pcedhr/james_naismith_would_be_rolling_in_his_grave_if/,768,54,James Naismith would be rolling in his grave if he saw the middle school game I refereed yesterday.,"7th/8th grade double header between a mid sized ""urban"" public school visiting a mid sized private school. The 8th grade game itself was fine and competent with the public school winning by about 10. The seventh grade game was a comedy of errors and an affront to the entire sport. Let's count the ways.
Visiting school bus didn't arrive until 15 minutes after the scheduled start. Blame a 4:30 start and traveling across a city that doesn't have a great highway system.
Home school had two non-working scoreboards on opposite walls. Instead, the scorer's table had a video board on the front facade controlled by a wireless tablet. Problem was there was no connection between the tablet and video board to start the first game, so for the first quarter the scoreboard did not update at all. They're able to get the clock to work in the second quarter but the score doesn't update in real time. It delays for a minute before updating. They are able to get this fixed during halftime.
Several players on all teams wearing wrist bands and necklaces that we had to remind them to remove.
A player with two laces in each shoe which led to them coming undone multiple times.
Constantly had to remind players where they needed to stand during free throws. Called a lane violation on the visiting team when a player crossed the three point line to take a lane space while a home player was in the act of shooting.
Home coach arrived five minutes before game time. I get it, coaches aren't always school staff and come in from other jobs, but witnessed a school rep hand him his coach shirt and hand him a paper, telling him ""here's your player roster."" Coach didn't have the first clue. Only seemed to get animated when the other team would take and miss long two point jumpers. His assistant seemed to care a lot more.
I don't think the away team had an official numbered roster. They didn't bring a scorebook. They brought with them a bin of uniforms that I'm sure players just grabbed the first jersey they saw. As such we noticed two #23s. We call the tech and the home team splits the free throws, which changed the score from 27-1 to 27-2.
Visiting coach didn't know half of his team's names, and referred to several players by their numbers.
Home team played a zone defense entirely within the arc with no rotations. They made no effort to box out so they gave up at least three offensive rebounds seemingly every possession.
Visiting team continued to press up 30+.
One home player was called for carrying three times. And these were not borderline.
At one point I notice a visiting player change jerseys in a supply closet near the team bench and then he checked into the game a minute later. By this point the game is a laugher and we decide that we'll leave it up to the home scorekeeper if they want to make an issue out of it, which they don't.
Start of the fourth quarter, home team inbounding with the entire team on their offensive side of the floor. Entire visiting team on their offensive side of the floor. I'm administering the inbound and mention to the visiting team ""you know you guys are on defense, right?"" They stare at me dumbfounded. I say ""Alright, you're gonna learn the hard way."" I hand the ball to the home player who passes to his teammate in their front court who then dribbles the other direction across half court, forcing me to call a back court violation. Front row spectators had a good laugh at that.
Up 48-11 in the final minute, visiting team coach openly encouraged scoring again to reach 50, not out of animosity to the home team, but he just wanted the satisfaction of doing it. Didn't happen because....
EVERYBODY'S jumper was broke.
This was ""select"" basketball in name only. I took my complimentary Gatorade and protein bar and got out. Hopefully the game payment comes through.",

And it can't be this easy.,"Been playing for past 15 years, the highest level I played was semi pro overseas at PG. I'm well passed my prime and just play as a weekend warrior for fun. I can drive and dribble with me left and right hand, and also can lay it up with left or right hand. I have your basic cross over between the legs that iv always used to get by.
Playing with people 10 years younger than me, iv noticed that everyone basically cheats on offense, whether push offs, carrying, the ball, or this bs hand slapping the defenders hand away. 
Once I realized that I'll never play a competitive organized Game of basketball, I started to dribble like these young fools. 
I started to carry the ball putting my hand under and added a hesitation dribble. Once I started doing this, it was basically cheating. I blow by defenders like it was nothing because they think I'm going to shoot it everytime. I do a crossover, counter whatever the defense is doing, then hesitation. It works everytime. 
This move is basically broken. It creates an unlimited ammunition for the offense. And if I'm being honest, it's purely cheating.",

Basketball,https://old.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/1l46ow4/ive_become_a_shooter_in_less_than_a_month/,735,94,I’ve become a shooter in less than a month.,"TLDR: This is how I went from being an average non-pro shooter, to a really good non-pro shooter in under a month.
I’ve been experimenting, practicing, asking for advice, trying everything I could to become a shooter as I’m getting older. Here’s what I did in order from most effective to least.
Changed my eye focus.  I posted about this on reddit, but many people seemed to think it was unnecessary.  I’ve envisioned many different things to change my eye focus.  What’s worked most effectively is instead of aiming for a general area of the hoop, I’ve zeroed in on a tiny grain of salt sized target on the back of the rim (I tend to shoot short), and I imagine I’m trying to shoot high and nip it the tiny target with a marble. “Adding a scope to my shot” has helped tremendously even with inconsistent form, this is what makes or breaks most of my shots. Form is still important, just not as important as my focus.
Shoot every day. Only count swishes. Make a goal like 10-20 swishes from a spot before moving to the next. I make between 100-200 swishes a day.
Always warm up with form shooting.
That’s basically it.
Outside of this, I tweak my form if I’m noticing things.
I used the “Home Court” phone app to count makes and misses. Over a month ago I started at a little under 40%.  About a week or 2 ago I hit around 68% (noticeable improvement for me even without the app I can tell).  I haven’t used the app these last few days but I’m def shooting better than 68% now. I’m gonna test it this weekend.
It’s really crazy. Just wanted to share my experience for anyone who’s looking for ideas.",
Basketball,https://old.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/1na43ua/2s_and_3s_should_be_the_norm_in_pickup_its/,724,244,2s and 3s should be the norm in pickup. It’s “basketball” not “jog and chuck 3s,"I find 1s and 2s to be a terrible scoring system. The 3 is already powerful, when it’s worth twice as much as a layup it breaks the game. I don’t care if it’s easier to keep score. Guys are gonna argue about the score regardless. The math is not that hard.
When games are scored 1s and 2s it often devolves into quick blowouts or drawn out chuckfests. Guys run less and you always get one guy who thinks it’s his job to stand at the arc, chuck 3s and yell at the big man (me) for not snatching every 10 foot rebound as if I can teleport. It over-emphasizes a part of the game that doesn’t need it and it leads to boring one-dimensional basketball.
I know some of y’all are gonna say “get better at shooting 3s”. I’m a fine 3pt shooter. I’m not a walking bucket but I know when I’m feeling it. It’s a part of my game, not my whole game.
Think about it. NBA scores 2s and 3s and the 3 is still the most popular shot in the pro game. If it was scored 1s and 2s no one would take a layup. I feel like too many pickup players take advantage of 1s and 2s to play lazy basketball because they think they are snipers. If you are this type of player you will probably get really butthurt about this post. Oh well.
Play 2s and 3s. Rant over.
EDIT: Thanks for the discussion guys. Some good points about half vs fullcourt and 1s and 2s being simpler and faster. I think my favorite suggestion is to just play 1s.
A lot of this can be mitigated by playing with decent players that know how to defend, communicate and play team ball. I guess I just worry about the state of the street game and how younger players are learning the game.
And my apologies for the saltiness.",

It’s a lose-lose situation because calling a carry always makes you look like a fool, yet I can’t bring myself to carry as egregiously as everyone else. So, it’s just something you have to put up with.
The biggest shame in all of this is that kids today are incredibly skilled and talented, to the point where they don’t even need to carry—yet it’s become the norm.

I feel like people are FINALLY starting to appreciate LeBron and the totality of his career instead of demeaning every little thing he does.
For example, when he got dunked on in the gold medal final game everybody was jokingly saying “delete the footage” instead of stuff like “MJ would never get dunked on” which would’ve happened like 4 years ago especially after the whole last dance doc. Obviously a portion of people still say those dumb things but I feel like most people are showing love to Bron and finally appreciating his career.
Idk if it’s because he’s about to retire or that the people in the media are become more of LeBron's contemporaries and that more people of MJ contemporaries are on their way out of media but he’s finally getting the love that he ALWAYS deserved!
I genuinely never understood why Bron had haters . It can’t be because he just switched teams in a professional team sport it’s more than that which is weird. He’s basically the perfect role model with no allegations outside the court unlike someone like Jordan who unfortunately had his gambling issues.
Overall I’m just glad LeBron is finally getting his flowers. It took long energy h but people are finally coming around.",

I’ll sprint hills, do suicides, weighted jumps, then go straight into ball-handling while I’m gasping for air, forcing control when everything in me wants to shake. Other times I slow it down, shoot barefoot, breathe deep, treat every release like meditation.

Even though I'm not that good, I still love the sport but now he's making me do another sport like volleyball which in my opinion don't like. I still want to play basketball all my life, but my dad is discouraging me he keeps complaining that I could do better. Someone please help.",

But the thing is you can't leave him open not even for a split second, because even though he shoots the goofiest possible cartoonish Manny Paquaio jumpshot, he somehow hits consistently 3/4 of his 3 point attempts, even when contested
You people likely know such players as well. It is so demotivating because i spent years training my shot and I literally shoot several times less accurate than some goofball (no insult)
My question is, HOOOOOW THE F*****K DO THEY DO THAT?",

You guys were so helpful in September when my son picked up a basketball for the first time. It’s been four months now and he is addicted! He goes to a skills and drills camp twice a week, interns there twice a week (just helps out in the middle school class with whatever the couch needs), and started the Y league where he plays another two days per week, and got a basketball hoop for Christmas.
He’s now getting ready to go to a more competitive league in March! I just need to find someone to help him with big man skills which isn’t really focused on at his skills camp, so that’s the next thing to track down.
PS- he was 6’5” when I initially posted but now we are up to 6’6” with a 6’9” wingspan.",

I think they play on the high school team so they are skilled. However I got matched up against one of them and it felt kinda awkward. First, they are female so I didn't want to play physical, but if they cook you then it's kinda embarrassing. It's a lose lose situation. Second, they are teenagers so I basically didn't want to touch them. I would just put my hand up in the air if they shot but didn't really get close. And if there was a fast break, I'd basically let her get the layup without really jumping to contest cause I didn't want anyone to get hurt.
How do you fellas handle being matched up with a girl?",

I played my sisters. They played at The University of Missouri and I was still a young kid. They had me playing on the scout team and they had a few WNBA players on their team like, Sophie Cunningham and a couple others. I was in the 7th or 8th grade going crazy. So, I have real life experience. It's just a difference and I wish this would stop being a conversation because it should be common sense. I appreciate common sense. I feel sometimes that's lost a little bit.”
Via Ball in the family podcast with Lonzo & Gelo Ball
I do think NBA players in 8th grade like MPJ who was always a top ranked prospect all his grade school days would still be able to compete especially since he always had the size on him too. Maybe inexperience would have gotten him but I don't think he would have gotten absolutely cooked.",

The answers generally included a lot of accounts of NBA scrubs destroying regular players but I never saw good imperical data applied to the question.
Turns out it’s actually pretty simple. If you are the absolute worst player on an NBA roster today it is fairly safe to say that there are 449 men in the world who are better at basketball than you are and 4,000,000,000 men in the world that you are better at basketball than. The worst nba player is better than 99.999989% of the population at basketball.
When I was in high school we had a future NBA player, Brian Cardinal, playing for a team in our conference. In the nba he was a bench/dirty work guy who never managed to average 10 points a game in a 12 year career. In college he was one of the best players in Purdue’s history. In high school he was an unstoppable God.",

I'm a 5'9"" white dude who had NBA dreams until about puberty when I realized I wasn't even the best player in my little New England town.  But here's the thing, you don't need to go pro for basketball to be your joy in life.
I played varsity basketball at a decent sized high school.  No college for me, for athletics or education.  I moved to northern New Hampshire, and it's not exactly basketball country around here.
But! I always found local pickup games.  I started one myself at our local middle school which I've been running for 13 years.  I met and made lifelong friends going to these weekly runs.  I played in leagues.  I'm playing in a men's tournament this weekend.  I also coach at the same middle school.  I love the NBA and still watch it regularly and devour multiple pods (please come back Zach Lowe).
Long story short, you don't need to play in the NBA to find a lifelong joy in basketball.  I'm a random average sized 40 year old white dude in northern NH, and it's been a constant in my life the whole time.  Truly out here for the love of the game.  It's my happy place.
And finally, please pray for my Achilles this weekend.  🤣",
