Amd,https://old.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/k1mnga/the_moderators_of_ramd_do_not_condone_locating/,35338,1167,"The moderators of /r/AMD do NOT condone locating scalper auctions, leaving dozens of absurd bids, so as to repeatedly derail a scalper's opportunity to make a sale and ultimately de-incentivize PC hardware scalping.","There have been some whispers through the grapevine in many internet communities about a sad, wrong, and mean practice that I can only describe as pure evil. Folks, today I learned that there are people out there that use software tools to
derail
eBay listings for scalped graphics cards. Yes, that's right... people are using software to give themselves an unfair advantage in the exchange of PC hardware from manufacturers to consumers! WHO WOULD DO SUCH A THING!?  For example,
see this well-known, already completed, eBay auction
from days ago. Evil cyber criminals decimated this totally innocent and honest listing with dozens of fake bids. They bidded so rapidly, the lister couldn't even
cancel them
all - So sad!
Doing this isn't a good idea because it could get your account banned from eBay... unless you were to use, say, a
VPN service
to make a bunch of throwaway eBay accounts and stockpile their logins in a spreadsheet or something haha... IDK... or maybe everyone in the bid history is safe as long as the upper-most bid is fake? I don't entirely know how this dark underbelly criminal enterprise works, I'm just here to get the word out. So very shocking, all of this.
Again, do NOT do this. Scalpers are providing a
valuable service
to the PC gaming community when they pay $5 for bot scripts that snap up entire shipments of hardware from etailers and then automatically create auctions on other websites, pulling a 10x turnaround before the hardware even hits the first warehouse's shelves. It would be wrong to use bot scripts to deprive them of their right to trade graphics cards -
just put yourselves in their shoes
. They would
never
use technology maliciously to deprive
you
of a graphics card trade, would they? No. Never.
Also - do not
create
,
share
, and use bot scripts or other software tools designed to derail these auctions with said throwaway eBay accounts (fully automated, or machine-assisted via URL scraping, doesn't matter). It's simply a very immoral and reprehensible thing to do. This should go without saying, but it's also very wrong to create and share public anti-scalper Telegram channels and Discord servers with the sole purpose of sharing eBay listings with each other for you, or your bid-bombing bots, to... well... bid-bomb. Very bad - do not do.
Again - Please do not do any of these things. They will only get the account, and its hundreds (possibly thousands, if you bot) of dirty bids, banned from eBay (unless, again, the account merely drove up the bid price but wasn't the winner of the auction - they'd just be able to claim ""Oh, I bought something else because I didn't win. If only you had told me 5 minutes sooner. Darn!"").
Just imagining the
distraught and panicked
look on this poor scalper's face when they're forced to stay up late into the night doing
real, actual work
, cancelling bids for hours on end as new stock trickles back onto the shelf should be enough to motivate you to not do it. They'd miss out on so many interactions with their loving friends and family that definitely exist. It just breaks my heart! What kind of
awful
person would use bot software to turn the tides of online sales in their own favor and deprive PC users of hardware? So very sad... to think, with each passing week, the shelf price falls further and further below what the scalpers paid on launch day... sometimes to the point that they might begin to wonder if their main source of income being ""owning someone else's graphics cards"" was a smart long-term idea...
So, anyways... thanks for reading.",

Amd,https://old.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/gmp45o/the_zen_3_architecture_is_coming_to_amd_x470_and/,17099,2272,"The ""Zen 3"" Architecture is Coming to AMD X470 and B450","As we head into our upcoming “Zen 3” architecture, there are considerable technical challenges that face a CPU socket as long-lived as AMD Socket AM4. For example,
we recently announced
that we would not support “Zen 3” on AMD 400 Series motherboards due to serious constraints in SPI ROM capacities in most of the AMD 400 Series motherboards. This is not the first time a technical hurdle has come up with Socket AM4 given the longevity of this socket, but it
is
the first time our enthusiasts have faced such a hurdle.
Over the past week, we closely reviewed your feedback on that news: we watched every video, read every comment and saw every Tweet. We hear that many of you hoped for a longer upgrade path. We hear your hope that AMD B450 and X470 chipsets would carry you into the “Zen 3” era.
Our experience has been that large-scale BIOS upgrades can be difficult and confusing especially as processors come on and off the support lists.  As the community of Socket AM4 customers has grown over the past three years, our intention was to take a path forward that provides the safest upgrade experience for the largest number of users. However, we hear you loud and clear when you tell us you would like to see B450 or X470 boards extended to the next generation “Zen 3” products.
As the team weighed your feedback against the technical challenges we face, we decided to change course. As a result, we will enable an upgrade path for B450 and X470 customers that adds support for next-gen AMD Ryzen™ Processors with the “Zen 3” architecture. This decision is very fresh, but here is a first look at how the upgrade path is expected to work for customers of these motherboards.
1) We will develop and enable our motherboard partners with the code to support “Zen 3”-based processors in select beta BIOSes for AMD B450 and X470 motherboards.
2) These optional BIOS updates will disable support for many existing AMD Ryzen™ Desktop Processor models to make the necessary ROM space available.
3) The select beta BIOSes will enable a one-way upgrade path for AMD Ryzen Processors with “Zen 3,” coming later this year. Flashing back to an older BIOS version will not be supported.
4) To reduce the potential for confusion, our intent is to offer BIOS download only to verified customers of 400 Series motherboards who have purchased a new desktop processor with “Zen 3” inside. This will help us ensure that customers have a bootable processor on-hand after the BIOS flash, minimizing the risk a user could get caught in a no-boot situation.
5) Timing and availability of the BIOS updates will vary and may not immediately coincide with the availability of the first “Zen 3”-based processors.
6) This is the final pathway AMD can enable for 400 Series motherboards to add new CPU support. CPU releases beyond “Zen 3” will require a newer motherboard.
7) AMD continues to recommend that customers choose an AMD 500 Series motherboard for the best performance and features with our new CPUs.
There are still many details to iron out, but we’ve already started the necessary planning. As we get closer to the launch of this upgrade path, you should expect another blog just like this to provide the remaining details and a walkthrough of the specific process.
At CES 2017, AMD made a commitment: we would
support AMD Socket AM4 until 2020
. We’ve spent the next three years working very hard to fulfill that promise across four architectures, plus pioneering use of new technologies like chiplets and PCIe® Gen 4. Thanks to your feedback, we are now set to bring “Zen 3” to the AMD 400 Series chipsets. We’re grateful for your passion and support of AMD’s products and technologies.
We’ll talk again soon.",

WHAT WE CANNOT DISCUSS
AMD is a publicly-traded company in the US, and it must comply with certain laws and regulations. Chief amongst those regulations is
Regulation Fair Disclosure
(RegFD), mandated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This law states that AMD must disclose previously unknown product or financial information to all investors simultaneously. Not every investor reads Reddit, so Reddit cannot be a platform for new or unreleased product info. We have to issue press releases (or similar) for information like that!
So: if you haven't seen it mentioned in an official AMD presentation, investor update, press release, blog, or webpage we legally cannot comment. Sorry, y'all. That also means we can't discuss much on VEGA.
Let's do this!
//EDIT: Hi, everyone! Winners are being contacted right now. Stay tuned. Reminder: entry cutoff was at noon CST on 3/3.
//EDIT #2: Still waiting on 5 confirmations from winners. Check your PMs, folks.
//EDIT #3: Two confirmations remaining.

Even nvidia had the courtesy of giving 72 hours for potential customers to decide whether or not the price to performance ratio was worth it.
We know the RDNA2 cards will be in short supply and high demand. Regardless of performance, they'll sell because if you want new hardware this year, you don't really have a choice... But this exclusively hurts the early adopting enthusiasts who are unwilling to buy something without being knowledgeable about their purchase. By the time they get the information they need from reviews, they'll be sold out and they'll be stuck waiting god knows how long to get another shot with decent supply.
RTX3000 series AIB review embargoes dropped the minute they went up for sale too but at least consumers knew the baseline performance for the FE cards. We don't even have that. Between the SAM debacle and the review embargo situation for Zen 3 and RDNA2, personally they've pissed any good will I had towards them as they become just another scummy corporation doing scummy things with cultists worshipping every anti-consumer move they make.
This benefits nobody except for AMD and day traders that will flip the stock the second it's inconvenient to them
(and speaking as an investor that bought at $2.24/share a couple years ago, I'm not happy about this, it leads me to believe they have something to hide, I'm just pointing this out because I literally have a financial incentive for AMD to do well and even I don't support these practices).
Edit: The responses here are fucking pathetic. When AMD becomes the next Intel, you'll deserve it with your shitty cult worship.",

This is how they're able to get away with it - a misstep of justice, but legally passable. See the bottom summary for more information!
A few days ago,
a small internet uproar
occured when it was discovered that Intel's MKL (that powers Matlab) changes its performance not based on CPU features, but on the company that made the CPU.
I made a
stickied comment
there initially intending to summarize and compile the important details, but in doing so I fell down a rabbit hole. I'm not a trade lawyer, but this stuff seems pretty damning with even a general layman's scan.
I dug into an old
FTC investigation from 2009-2010
that
determined
, not only did the FTC
order
intel to STOP doing exactly what they're doing today, but they
call out Intel's Math Kernel Library by name
(which can be found in the last page of the conclusion):
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall not make any engineering or design change to a Relevant Product if that change (1) degrades the performance of a Relevant Product sold by a competitor of Respondent and (2) does not provide an actual benefit to the Relevant Product sold by Respondent, including without limitation any improvement in performance, operation, cost, manufacturability, reliability, compatibility, or ability to operate or enhance the operation of another product; provided, however, that any degradation of the performance of a competing product shall not itself be deemed to be a benefit to the Relevant Product sold by Respondent. Respondent shall have the burden of demonstrating that any engineering or design change at issue complies with Section V. of this Order.
The only way Intel can avoid guilt from this statement is by either proving that the version of the compiler Matlab uses is from before the settlement, or by falling under this exception:
Provided, however, that the fact that the degradation of performance of a Relevant Product sold by a competitor of Respondent arises from a “bug” or other inadvertent product defect in and of itself shall not constitute a violation of Section V.A.1. Respondent shall have the burden of demonstrating that any such degradation of performance was inadvertent.
Can anyone else make sense of this? How is a multi billion dollar company in seemingly blatant violation of an order from the Federal Trade Commision (continuously) for almost 10 years after getting caught?

Edit: More information in a good reply by

here
. Here,
/u/night0x63
finds that (legally speaking) Intel may actually not be required to
stop
sabotaging performance, but ""skirted"" a bit, and is legally required to
disclose
that they do. As
/u/demonstar55
points out,
this disclaimer is present in the footnotes if you want to read it
. (using a blurry GIF image, which is immune to search engine crawling and keyword searching)!
/u/smartcom5
discovered that Intel, at some point, converted it to an image and trimmed off a lot of useful information. tl;dr: Write things very carefully if you work in the FTC.
IN SUMMARY
Thanks to more digging by people who are much better at interpreting legal documents than I, we have concluded how and why Intel is able to do this, despite being investigated for it:
Intel's Math Kernel Library is NOT a compiler, incase anyone confuses it with one. Doesn't really matter to the FTC or consumers, but some wished to stress this.
How Intel gets away with it: The ""Relevant Products"" section means (i) Relevant Microprocessor Products and (ii) Relevant GPUs (as defined on PAGE 5).
Intel's MKL may hurt performance of AMD processors, but almost nothing uses it (you're probably not ever going to use it)
Other Intel compilers and libraries have done this in the past
The FTC investigated them and, at the very least, requires them to disclose what they do
It's wrong regardless, but at least it's limited to very few consumer software products (currently)
The great debate: Is it wrong to build libraries and compilers to utilize technologies that have been industry compatibility standard for years, and only use those features if the CPU is made by yourself? The FTC thinks so. Consumers think so. But, ultimately, the FTC is happy to live with it as long as Intel discloses this dark behavior to the millions that use and rely on down-stream technology, and the misleading benchmarks it helps fabricate...

AMD is not your friend.
This is purely 100% a business decision.
Consumers defending this are exactly why these tech companies gouge and become so complacent with anti consumer practices in the first place. I mean just look at Nvidia and their sky high prices, but it doesn't matter because people are still buying their cards, and that's the go ahead signal that tells them to keep fucking us.
Intel got made fun of all this time because 9900Ks could have worked on many Z170 boards. But they chose to artificially create a segmentation and force people to upgrade. People used AMD as example, ""oh Intel why can you be more like amd"".
But now AMD are finding themselves in the exact same shoes, but this time it's ""well hur durr they didn't promise you anything get over it"". It's not a matter of promising, it's a matter of providing people the full benefit for their product. Ryzen 4000 should have been compatible but it's not for the stupidest reason that's been debunked.
AMD just because you're winning now does warrant you to indulge in anti consumer behavior now.
EDIT: It's sad and also hilarious at the same time to see so many people turn a blind-eye to this when its literally the same thing all these guys gave Intel shit for.
EDIT 2: If there was an alternative universe where DOOMGUY had to go around slaying AMD fanboys, I think even he would quit because of how fucking insufferable these people are.
EDIT 3: For the people saying I'm entitled and saying I'm preventing amd from making money are missing the point. Im not saying amd shouldn't conduct their business, but just know that we need to be aware of their true motives and any sort anti-consumer tactics should be called out. If you stay quiet and continue to let them do whatever, then don't be surprised when the next gen cpus aren't as cheap as you thought they were going to be.",

30 CPUs in Cyberpunk at 720p
found that the 10900k can match the 5950X and beat the 5900X, while the 5600X performs about equal to a i5 10400F.
While the article doesn't mention it, if you run the game on an AMD CPU and check your usage in task manager, it seems to utilise 4 (logical, 2 physical) cores in frequent bursts up to 100% usage, where as the rest of the physical cores sit around 40-60%, and their logical counterparts remaining idle.
Here is an example using the 5950X (3080, 1440p Ultra RT + DLSS)
And 720p Ultra, RT and DLSS off
A friend running it on a 5600X reported the same thing occuring.
Compared to an Intel i7 9750H, you can see that all cores
are being utilised
equally, with none jumping like that.
This could be deliberate optimisation or a bug, don't know for sure until they release a statement. Post below if you have an older Ryzen (or intel) and what the CPU usage looks like.
Edit:
Beware that this should work best with lower core CPUs (8 and below) and may not perform better with high core multi-CCX CPUs (12 and above, etc), although some people are still reporting improved minimum frames
Thanks to
/u/UnhingedDoork
's post about
hex patching the exe to make the game think you are using an Intel processor
, you can try this out to see if you may get more performance out of it.
Helpful step-by-step instructions I also found
And even a video tutorial
Some of my own quick testing:
720p low, default exe, cores fixed to 4.3Ghz
: FPS seems to hover in the 115-123 range
720p low, patched exe, cores fixed to 4.3Ghz
: FPS seems to hover in the 100-112 range, all threads at medium usage (So actually worse FPS on a 5950X)
720p low, default exe, CCX 2 disabled
: FPS seems to hover in the 118-123 range
720p low, patched exe, CCX 2 disabled
: FPS seems to hover in the 120-124 range, all threads at high usage
1080P Ultra RT + DLSS, default exe, CCX 2 disabled
: FPS seems to hover in the 76-80 range
1080P Ultra RT + DLSS, patched exe: CCX 2 disabled
: FPS seems to hover in the 80-81 range, all threads at high usage
From the above results, you may see a performance improvement if your CPU only has 1 CCX (or <= 8 cores). For 2 CCX CPUs (with >= 12 cores), switching to the intel patch may incur a performance overhead and actually give you worse performance than before.
If anyone has time to do detailed testing with a 5950X,
this is a suggested table
of tests, as the 5950X should be able to emulate any of the other Zen 3 processors.",

Honestly, the battlestations on

is just pointless to me. There's an
r/battlestations
for a reason. This is an AMD subreddit, not a place for people to show off their new builds. It gets annoying and it's counterproductive to me—we could have much more interesting conversations over ""oooh look at my PC."" I think the battlestation posts should completely disappear. This is literally just promoting the terrible ideal of ""I spend 2000 dollars, I get 2000 upvotes.""
